**Distributed Systems & Scalable Cloud-Native Services**

**Primary Languages:** Java (Spring Boot), Python  
**Secondary:** Go, Node.js

**Why this works:**

- Keeps **Architect** keyword (experience signal for seniority)
    
- Anchors to **backend & distributed systems** — avoids runtime / infra nightmares
    
- Enterprise-friendly phrasing — recruiters won’t think you’re a “core platform” hero
