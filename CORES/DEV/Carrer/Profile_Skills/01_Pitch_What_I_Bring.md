Below is a **1-page “What I Bring” pitch** you can **read verbatim**, paste into an email, or use as a **talking script in founder/CTO calls**.  
It is written to **de-risk you**, avoid “over-engineering” fear, and clearly state **value + boundaries**.

# What I Bring as a Systems / Platform Engineer

### 1️⃣ I build systems that survive real usage

I specialize in **backend and platform systems that don’t fall apart under load, complexity, or growth**.

- Design APIs and services with **clear failure modes**
    
- Build async, event-driven systems using **Node.js and Python**
    
- Handle background jobs, streaming, workers, and queues
    
- Scale systems **incrementally**, not prematurely
    

If your product has passed “toy stage” and reliability matters, I can own that layer end-to-end.

---

### 2️⃣ I think in SLAs, not frameworks

I don’t start with tools — I start with **expectations**.

- Latency targets
    
- Throughput assumptions
    
- Failure isolation
    
- Degradation strategies
    

From there, I choose the **simplest architecture that meets today’s needs** and leaves room for tomorrow.

I actively avoid gold-plating and will say _no_ when complexity isn’t justified.

---

### 3️⃣ I make security a default, not a rewrite

I bring **practical application security**, not checkbox compliance.

- OAuth2 / OpenID Connect
    
- Keycloak-based IAM
    
- Secure multi-tenant design
    
- OWASP-aware API design
    
- Rate limiting, auth boundaries, token strategies
    

This reduces future rewrites, audits panic, and customer trust issues.

---

### 4️⃣ I debug what others can’t

When things go wrong in production, I’m effective.

- Performance profiling (CPU, memory, I/O)
    
- Tracing async and distributed flows
    
- Root cause analysis under pressure
    
- Fixing issues across code, runtime, and infrastructure
    

I’m calm in outages and systematic in diagnosis.

---

### 5️⃣ I can build high-performance web frontends when it matters

I’m not just a CRUD UI developer.

- GPU-accelerated UIs (Three.js, WebGL2, WebGPU)
    
- Real-time dashboards and visualizations
    
- Performance-critical rendering
    
- Memory and frame-rate optimization
    

If your product involves **visualization, simulation, or real-time interaction**, I can deliver serious value here.

---

### 6️⃣ I’m hands-on and collaborative

I write code, review code, and mentor.

- Comfortable in ambiguity
    
- Work well with small teams
    
- Happy to unblock others
    
- Prefer clarity over hierarchy
    

I adapt to the stage of the company — from scrappy to scaling.

---

## What I Don’t Do (By Design)

- I’m not a **pure UI/UX designer**
    
- I’m not an **ML research engineer**
    
- I don’t over-engineer early MVPs
    
- I don’t chase hype over fundamentals
    

I focus on **systems that work**, scale, and can be evolved safely.

---

## Best Fit

I’m most effective in startups that:

- Are past initial MVP or moving quickly toward scale
    
- Care about reliability, security, and maintainability
    
- Want someone who can **own backend/platform complexity**
    
- Value depth over buzzwords
    

---

### Bottom line

If you want someone who can **build, debug, secure, and scale your system — and still ship**, that’s what I bring.
