# Startups You Should Avoid (Given Your Profile)

## 1️⃣ “Hype-first AI wrapper” startups 🚩🚩🚩

### How they sound

- “We’re an AI company”
    
- “We just plug into OpenAI/Claude”
    
- “The model does the hard work”
    
- “We’ll figure infra later”
    

### Reality

- Thin wrapper around APIs
    
- No real backend complexity
    
- Little respect for systems, security, or correctness
    
- Engineering decisions driven by demos, not reliability
    

### Why this is bad for you

- Your systems depth is wasted
    
- They won’t value SLAs, tracing, or security
    
- When things break, they blame infra but don’t want to invest in it
    
- You’ll be bored or frustrated fast
    

**Red flag question to ask them**

> “What happens if OpenAI rate limits you tomorrow?”

If they can’t answer — walk away.

## 2️⃣ “Move fast, break everything” founders 🚩🚩

### How they sound

- “We don’t need tests right now”
    
- “Infra is overkill”
    
- “Security later”
    
- “Just ship bro”
    

### Reality

- They confuse _speed_ with _recklessness_
    
- Technical debt becomes permanent
    
- Outages become normalized
    

### Why this is bad for you

- You’ll constantly be the “slow one”
    
- You’ll be ignored until production explodes
    
- Then suddenly everything is “your fault”
    

You value **controlled speed**, not chaos.

## 3️⃣ UI-only / growth-only startups 🚩

### How they sound

- “Frontend-heavy”
    
- “Design-led product”
    
- “Mostly React work”
    
- “Backend is simple”
    

### Reality

- Backend is treated as a nuisance
    
- Little appreciation for systems engineering
    
- Most problems are UX, marketing, or analytics
    

### Why this is bad for you

- Your backend + platform skills won’t be used
    
- You’ll be under-leveled as “frontend support”
    
- Long-term growth ceiling is low
    

You want **core-system ownership**, not edge work.

## 4️⃣ Founders who fear “over-engineering” irrationally 🚩

This is subtle but dangerous.

### How they sound

- “We don’t want architects”
    
- “Keep it simple” (without defining simple)
    
- “We don’t need observability”
    
- “Why do we need Kafka?”
    

### Reality

- They conflate _thinking_ with _overthinking_
    
- They’ve been burned by bad architects before
    
- They overcorrect in the opposite direction
    

### Why this is bad for you

- You’ll self-censor good ideas
    
- You’ll be blocked from fixing systemic issues
    
- Systems rot silently
    

Good founders don’t fear architecture — they fear **wasted complexity**. Big difference.

---

## 5️⃣ Founder-led tech with no real delegation 🚩🚩🚩

### How they sound

- “I review every PR”
    
- “I wrote most of the system”
    
- “I prefer to stay hands-on”
    

### Reality

- Micromanagement
    
- Ego-driven decisions
    
- Hard ceiling on impact
    

### Why this is bad for you

- You won’t get real ownership
    
- Your experience will be underutilized
    
- Decisions won’t be technical — they’ll be political
    

At your level, **ownership matters more than titles**.

---

## 6️⃣ Startups with no respect for ops / prod work 🚩

### How they sound

- “DevOps is not engineering”
    
- “Infra work is boring”
    
- “Let’s just restart the service”
    

### Reality

- Fragile systems
    
- No accountability
    
- Pager fatigue
    

### Why this is bad for you

- You’ll be the only adult in the room
    
- You’ll carry invisible responsibility
    
- Burnout risk is high
    

You want teams that respect **reliability as a feature**.

# Startups You SHOULD Target (Green Flags)

## ✅ 1. B2B SaaS or Infra-adjacent products

- Multi-tenant
    
- Security-sensitive
    
- Enterprise customers
    
- Long-term customers
    

They **value your exact strengths**.

---

## ✅ 2. AI startups that care about infra (not prompts)

Look for:

- Rate limiting
    
- Caching
    
- Pipelines
    
- Workers
    
- Data governance
    

These founders understand AI ≠ magic.

---

## ✅ 3. Startups past MVP (or close)

- First real customers
    
- Real outages
    
- Real scaling pain
    

They now **need someone like you**.

---

## ✅ 4. Founders who ask _how_ you think

Good sign if they ask:

- “How would you design this?”
    
- “What would you simplify?”
    
- “What tradeoffs would you make?”
    

They respect judgment, not just output.

# 🔍 Questions YOU Should Ask in Founder Calls

Use these to filter silently.

### Architecture

> “What part of the system worries you the most today?”

### Scale

> “What breaks first if traffic 10×?”

### Security

> “How do you handle auth and tenant isolation today?”

### Culture

> “How do you decide when to refactor vs ship?”

Bad answers reveal bad startups fast.

# Bottom Line (Direct Advice)

You are **not** an early-chaos-only engineer.  
You are a **stability, scale, and correctness multiplier**.

Avoid startups that:

- Worship speed without discipline
    
- Chase hype
    
- Don’t respect systems work
    

Target startups that:

- Are growing into complexity
    
- Want calm, experienced engineers
    
- Value reliability and ownership
