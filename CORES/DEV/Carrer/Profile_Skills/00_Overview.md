Below is a **clean, senior-grade Summary + Skill List** that positions you as:

- Systems / Platform Engineer
- Security-aware architect
- High-performance frontend engineer
- Distributed systems designer
    

No Java needed. No fluff.

# 🔹 Resume Summary (Refactored)

> **Senior Systems / Platform Architect with 20+ years of experience designing, building, and optimizing high-performance, distributed systems across cloud, storage, telecom, finance, and media domains.**
> 
> Deep expertise in **backend platforms using Node.js and Python**, with strong focus on **concurrency, streaming, event-driven architectures, and distributed workers**. Proven ability to design **microservice systems with clear SLAs, failure isolation, observability, and scalability guarantees**.
> 
> Strong background in **application and platform security**, including OAuth2/OIDC, SSO, Keycloak-based IAM, secure API design, and OWASP threat mitigation.
> 
> Equally strong in **high-performance web frontends**, having built GPU-accelerated, real-time applications using **Three.js, WebGL2, WebGPU, and React**, with emphasis on rendering performance, memory efficiency, and responsiveness.
> 
> Hands-on architect with deep experience in **performance optimization, tracing, debugging, and production troubleshooting**, spanning application code, runtimes, containers, and cloud infrastructure.

This summary does **four things clearly**:

1. Systems/platform first
2. Security is real, not buzzwords
3. Frontend = performance engineering
4. Architect + debugger, not diagram-only

# 🔹 Skills (Refactored & Tiered)

This structure matters a lot. It tells recruiters _how to think about you_.

---

## **Core Expertise**

- Distributed Systems Architecture
- Platform & Backend Engineering
- High-Concurrency & Async Systems
- Performance Optimization & Profiling
- System Design with SLAs, SLOs, and Failure Modes
- Production Debugging & Root Cause Analysis
- Secure Application & API Design
    

---

## **Backend / Systems Programming**

- **Node.js** (Event Loop, Streams, Backpressure, Clustering, Worker Threads)
- **Python** (FastAPI, Django, AsyncIO, Multiprocessing)
- Distributed Workers & Job Processing
- Event-Driven Systems & Messaging
- REST, GraphQL, gRPC-style APIs
    

**Messaging / Workflow**

- Apache Kafka
- RabbitMQ
- Apache Airflow
- Workflow Orchestration (Mistral, DAG-based systems)
    

---

## **Security & Identity (Application + Platform)**

- OAuth2, OpenID Connect (OIDC), JWT
- Single Sign-On (SSO)
- **Keycloak** (IAM, Realm design, Client policies, Federation)
- OWASP Top 10 (API & Web)
- Secure Multi-Tenant Architecture
- AuthN/AuthZ Models (RBAC, Token-based systems)
- API Rate Limiting, Throttling, Circuit Breakers
    

> This positions you as _security-aware by design_, not “security team dependent”.

---

## **High-Performance Frontend Engineering**

- **React** (Hooks, Rendering Optimization, State Architecture)
    
- GPU-accelerated rendering:
    
    - **Three.js**
    - **React-Three-Fiber**
    - **WebGL2**
    - **WebGPU**
        
- Real-time Web Applications
- WebSockets & Streaming UIs
- Perfprmance-critical UI (FPS, memory, draw-call optimization)
- SSR, PWA, Service Workers
- Data-intensive Visualization (D3.js)
    

This makes you a **frontend performance engineer**, not a UI developer.

---

## **Infrastructure & Cloud Platforms**

- Docker, Kubernetes
- CI/CD (Jenkins)
- AWS, GCP, Hybrid / Private Cloud
- Infrastructure-aware Application Design
- Multi-Tenant SaaS Platforms
    

---

## **Observability, Debugging & Reliability**

- Metrics, Tracing & Logging Design
- Prometheus-based Monitoring
- Distributed Tracing Concepts
- Performance Profiling (CPU, Memory, I/O)
- Debugging Production Systems
- Capacity Planning & Bottleneck Analysis
    

This is **architect-level credibility**.

---

## **Databases & Data Layer**

- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- MySQL
- Caching Strategies (Redis)
- Data Modeling for High-Throughput Systems
    

---

## **Low-Level & Performance Background**

- **C++**
- Memory Management & Profiling
- Native Extensions & Runtime Optimization
- Linux-based Systems
    

This quietly explains _why_ you’re good at systems work.

---

## 🧠 Why this works (important)

This refactor:

- Moves you **out of the crowded “Node/Python fullstack” bucket**
- Makes Java unnecessary
- Signals **staff/principal-level thinking**
- Attracts:
    
    - Platform teams
    - Infra-heavy product teams
    - Enterprise architects
    - AI-infra / high-performance UI teams
        

---

## ⚠️ One critical instruction (don’t ignore)

When you apply:

- **Do NOT apply as “Senior Full Stack Developer”**
    
- Apply as:
    
    - Senior Backend Engineer
    - Platform Engineer
    - Principal Engineer
    - Architect (Hands-on)
        

Your resume now supports that.
