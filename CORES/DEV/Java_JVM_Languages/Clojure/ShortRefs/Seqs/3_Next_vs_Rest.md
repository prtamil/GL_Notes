next vs rest real difference

###### ChatGPT said:

Great question — `next` and `rest` in Clojure are subtly different but _that difference matters_, especially when dealing with lazy or recursive sequences.

---

## ✅ **Key Differences:**

|Feature|`rest`|`next`|
|---|---|---|
|**Return on 1-element seq**|Returns `()` (empty seq)|Returns `nil`|
|**Always returns a seq?**|Yes — always returns a sequence (possibly empty)|No — returns a sequence _or_ `nil`|
|**Purpose**|Get the "rest" of the sequence (even if empty)|Get the "next" _only if it exists_|
|**Common use**|Used in recursion and lazy building|Used in iteration termination|

---

## 🔍 **Deep Example**:

```clojure 
(rest [1])   ;; => ()
(next [1])   ;; => nil

```

```clojure
(seq (rest [1]))   ;; => nil
(seq (next [1]))   ;; => nil

```

But with more elements:

```clojure 
(rest [1 2 3])   ;; => (2 3)
(next [1 2 3])   ;; => (2 3)

```

## 🧠 **How to Think About It**

- Use **`rest`** when you _need a sequence_, even if it’s empty.
    
- Use **`next`** when you _want to know if more elements exist_ — it's good in loops/recursion when termination matters.

## ✅ When to Use

### `rest`

- Safe for always continuing over a sequence
    
- Works well in lazy-seq or recursive calls:
    
```clojure
(defn my-seq [s]
  (when (seq s)
    (cons (first s) (lazy-seq (my-seq (rest s)))))
)


```
    

### `next`

- Ideal for iteration or stopping when there's no next:
    
```clojure
(loop [s some-seq]
  (when (next s)
    (println (first s))
    (recur (next s))))


```
