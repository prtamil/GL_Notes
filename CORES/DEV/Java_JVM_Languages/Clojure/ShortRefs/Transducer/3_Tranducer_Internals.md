## üß† How transducers work under the hood

A **transducer** is just a function that takes a **reducing function (`rf`)** and returns a new reducing function that wraps it.

---

## üõ† Step-by-step: Writing `my-double-xf`

```clojure
(transduce (my-double-xf) conj [] [1 2 3])
;; => [2 4 6]

(defn my-double-xf
  "A transducer that doubles each input value."
  []
  (fn [rf]                                ;; Step 1: Accept the downstream reducing function
    (fn                                  ;; Step 2: Return a new reducing function
      ([] (rf))                          ;; Step 3: Init arity - call rf with no args
      ([result] (rf result))             ;; Step 4: Completion arity - call rf with final result
      ([result input]                    ;; Step 5: Step arity - the core transformation
       (rf result (* 2 input))))))       ;; <-- Actual doubling logic

```
---

### üîç Line-by-line Breakdown

```clojure
(defn my-double-xf [])

```

Defines a transducer generator function with no parameters. Returns a transducer.

```clojure
(fn [rf] ...)

```

Accepts the **reducing function** `rf`. This function defines how to accumulate the result (e.g., `conj` or `+`).


```clojure
(fn ...)

```

Returns a new reducing function ‚Äî this is what will be used during `transduce`.


```clojure
([] (rf))

```

**Init arity**: When reduction starts, call the underlying `rf` with no args. Used by some reducers.


```clojure
([result] (rf result))

```
**Completion arity**: When reduction finishes, call the underlying `rf` to finalize result (e.g., flush buffer, clean up).


```clojure
([result input] (rf result (* 2 input)))

```

**Step arity**: Core transformation. Multiply input by 2, then pass it along to `rf`.

---

### üß™ Test It


```clojure
(transduce (my-double-xf) conj [] [1 2 3 4])
;; => [2 4 6 8]

(transduce (comp (my-double-xf) (filter even?)) conj [] [1 2 3])
;; => [2 4 6] (all are even after doubling)

```

---

### ‚ú® Summary

- A transducer is a higher-order function that returns a reducing function.
    
- It supports **3 arities**: `[]`, `[result]`, and `[result input]`.
    
- It enables you to build composable, reusable, high-performance transformations.

Awesome üòé Let's level up. We'll build two slightly more advanced custom transducers step-by-step:

---

## üîÅ 1. **Dedup Transducer**: Skip consecutive duplicates

### ‚úÖ Goal:


```clojure
(transduce (dedup-xf) conj [] [1 1 2 2 3 1 1])
;; => [1 2 3 1]

```

### üß† Idea:

- Keep track of the last seen value
    
- Only forward the input to `rf` if it's different from the last
    

---

### üõ† Implementation


```clojure
(defn dedup-xf []
  (fn [rf]
    (let [prev (volatile! ::none)] ;; use a volatile to track previous value
      (fn
        ([] (rf))
        ([result] (rf result))
        ([result input]
         (let [last @prev]
           (if (= input last)
             result
             (do
               (vreset! prev input)
               (rf result input))))))))
```
---

### üîç Explanation


```clojure
	(let [prev (volatile! ::none)])
```

- We create a `volatile!` (like a mutable box) to keep track of the last value seen.
    


```clojure
	(if (= input last)
	  result
	  (do
	    (vreset! prev input)
	    (rf result input)))

```

- If current input equals last seen, do nothing.
    
- Otherwise, update the last seen value and pass it to `rf`.
    

---

## üì¶ 2. **Batching Transducer**: Emit values in chunks

### ‚úÖ Goal:

Group inputs into batches of 3:


```clojure
(transduce (partition-xf 3) conj [] [1 2 3 4 5 6 7])
;; => [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]]

```

---

### üõ† Implementation


```clojure
(defn partition-xf [n]
  (fn [rf]
    (let [batch (volatile! [])]
      (fn
        ([] (rf))
        ([result]
         ;; On completion: emit leftover batch if any
         (let [final-batch @batch]
           (if (empty? final-batch)
             (rf result)
             (rf (rf result final-batch)))))
        ([result input]
         (let [new-batch (conj @batch input)]
           (if (= (count new-batch) n)
             (do
               (vreset! batch [])
               (rf result new-batch))
             (do
               (vreset! batch new-batch)
               result)))))))

```

---

### üîç Explanation


```clojure
(let [batch (volatile! [])])

```

Keeps accumulating input values.


```clojure
(if (= (count new-batch) n)
  ;; Emit full batch, reset
  (do (vreset! batch []) (rf result new-batch))
  ;; Else just store and move on
  (do (vreset! batch new-batch) result))

```

---

### üí¨ Test It


```clojure
(transduce (partition-xf 3) conj [] (range 10))
;; => [[0 1 2] [3 4 5] [6 7 8]]

(transduce (comp (partition-xf 3) (map #(reduce + %))) conj [] (range 10))
;; => [3 12 21] ;; sum of each batch

```

Would you like one for **sliding windows**, **mapcat**, or something like **rate limiting** next?

# Implementation of Transducer

Perfect! üß† Let‚Äôs build a **tiny version of `transduce`** from scratch to deeply understand how it works.

We‚Äôll call it `my-transduce`.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Goal:

Recreate this behavior:

```clojure
(transduce (map inc) + 0 [1 2 3])
;; => 9

```

So we need to:

- Apply the `xform` to `f` ‚Üí get a new reducing function
    
- Use `reduce` with that function, starting from `init`
    

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-step: Build `my-transduce`

```clojure
(defn my-transduce
  [xform f init coll]
  (let [rf (xform f)]            ;; Step 1: transform the reducer
    (reduce rf init coll)))      ;; Step 2: reduce with it

```

‚úÖ That‚Äôs literally it.

---

## üß™ Let‚Äôs Test It

```clojure
(my-transduce (map inc) + 0 [1 2 3])
;; => 9

(my-transduce (filter even?) conj [] [1 2 3 4])
;; => [2 4]

(my-transduce (comp (map inc) (filter even?)) conj [] [1 2 3 4])
;; => [2 4]

```

---

## üîç Line-by-line Explanation

```clojure
(defn my-transduce [xform f init coll]
  (let [rf (xform f)]     ;; 1Ô∏è‚É£ Apply transformation to the reducer
    (reduce rf init coll) ;; 2Ô∏è‚É£ Reduce the collection with the transformed reducer
))

```

- `xform f` creates a new reducing function that:
    
    - transforms input
        
    - then applies `f` (like `+`, `conj`, etc.)
        

---

## üîÑ Why is this powerful?

With transducers:

- You **compose** logic once, use it everywhere
    
- You can plug the same `xform` into:
    
    - `transduce`
        
    - `into`
        
    - `sequence`
        
    - `core.async` pipelines
