eduction what does this function do

###### ChatGPT said:

Ah yes — `eduction` is one of those low-key powerful functions in Clojure’s transducer world. Let’s break it down clearly.

---

## 🧠 What is `eduction`?

```clojure
(eduction xform coll)

```

It returns a **lazy, reducible, iterable** view over the collection `coll`, with `xform` applied.

---

## 🔍 In Plain English:

- **`eduction` is like a lazy version of `transduce`**, except:
    
    - It doesn’t immediately reduce
        
    - It returns something you can pass to `reduce`, `into`, `map`, etc.
        
    - It avoids intermediate sequences — it's composable and lazy
        

---

### 🧪 Example:

```clojure
(def xf (comp (map inc) (filter even?)))

(eduction xf [1 2 3 4])
;; => a reducible (you can see the result only when you consume it)

(into [] (eduction xf [1 2 3 4]))
;; => [2 4]

```
---

### 🔁 How is this different from `sequence`?

|Feature|`sequence`|`eduction`|
|---|---|---|
|Lazy?|✅ Yes|✅ Yes|
|Real seq?|✅ LazySeq|❌ Not a seq|
|Reducible?|❌ Not efficiently|✅ Very efficiently|
|Intermediate allocation?|❌ Sometimes|✅ Avoids it|

So, if you plan to reduce/map/filter a lot or work with `core.async`, `eduction` is a better fit.

---

## 🔧 Analogy

Imagine `transduce` is a **microwave** that cooks your food immediately.

`eduction` is a **packed lunch**:

- It's _ready_, _transformed_, but not yet eaten.
    
- You can eat it however you like: slowly (reduce), fully (into), or lazily (map over it).
    

---

## 💡 When to use `eduction`

Use `eduction` when:

- You want to **re-use** a transducer but **delay execution**
    
- You’re feeding a transducer pipeline into another reducer, like:
    
```clojure
(reduce + (eduction (map inc) [1 2 3]))
;; => 9

```

Would you like to build a mini version of `eduction` next? Or compare `eduction` vs `sequence` in more practical terms?

yes mini version of eduction

###### ChatGPT said:

Awesome! Let’s build a **mini version of `eduction`** to see what it's really doing.

---

## 🎯 Goal:

Recreate this behavior:

```clojure
(into [] (eduction (map inc) [1 2 3]))
;; => [2 3 4]

```

---

## 💡 What does `eduction` do?

It returns a **reducible**, which means:

- You can pass it to `reduce`, `into`, `transduce`, etc.
    
- But it doesn't do anything until you reduce it
    

In our mini version, we’ll create a function that:

1. Accepts a transducer and a collection
    
2. Returns something reducible (i.e., something that works with `reduce`)
    

---

## 🧪 Mini `eduction`

```clojure
(defn my-eduction [xform coll]
  (reify
    clojure.lang.IReduceInit
    (reduce [_ rf init]
      (reduce (xform rf) init coll))))

```

---

## 🔍 Line-by-line Breakdown

```clojure
(defn my-eduction [xform coll]

```

We take a transducer and a collection.

```clojure
  (reify
    clojure.lang.IReduceInit

```

We return an object that implements the **`IReduceInit`** interface — so Clojure knows how to reduce it.

```clojure
    (reduce [_ rf init]
      (reduce (xform rf) init coll))))

```

When someone calls `reduce` on this object:

- We transform the reducing function `rf` using `xform`
    
- Then reduce over `coll` with it
    

---

## ✅ Try It Out

```clojure
(def xf (comp (map inc) (filter even?)))

(into [] (my-eduction xf [1 2 3 4]))
;; => [2 4]

```

Works just like `eduction`!

---

## 🚀 You Can Even Do This:

```clojure
(reduce + (my-eduction (map inc) [1 2 3]))
;; => 9

```

---

## 🤓 Bonus: Why `reify`?

`reify` creates an object that implements protocols. `eduction` returns an object that implements `IReduceInit` and friends, so Clojure knows how to reduce it _efficiently_ — without making an intermediate lazy seq.
