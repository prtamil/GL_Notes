# Transducers vs Normal scenario on Comp 

in transduce comp i need to follow right to left. but in normal comp i need to think in terms of left to right

Ah, this is a **super sharp** and insightful observation. You're touching on a **real mind-bender** in Clojure — the interaction between `comp` and `transduce`.

Let’s break it down carefully:

---

## 🧠 `comp` is always **right to left**


`(comp f g h) ;; => (fn [x] (f (g (h x))))`

So:


`((comp str inc) 4) ;; => "5" ;; inc runs first → str runs last`

✅ Easy to remember: `comp` is like nested parentheses from right to left.

---

## 🤔 But with `transduce`, it **feels** reversed

`(transduce (comp f g) ...)`

Suddenly it **feels** like `f` runs first, then `g`.

Let’s explain this carefully.

---

## 🎯 What's really happening in `transduce (comp f g)`?

In `transduce`, the `comp` builds a **_composed reducing function_** — not a regular function from x → y.

Here’s the trick: `comp` is still **right to left**, but it composes **transformers**, not values.

So:


`(transduce (comp (map inc) (filter even?)) conj [1 2 3 4])`

This feels like:

1. `filter even?` happens first
    
2. Then `map inc`
    

But we wrote:


`(comp (map inc) (filter even?))`

**Right to left?** Then `map` happens first? 🤔

---

## 💥 Here’s the truth:

### ✅ `comp` is **always right to left**

But in **transducers**, each function **wraps the reducing function** from the **outside in**.

So this:

`(comp (map inc) (filter even?))`

expands to:

`(map inc (filter even? rf))`

Which means:

- Input → goes through `filter even?` → then through `map inc` → then into the reducer
    

So **data flows left to right**, even though function composition is right to left.

---

## 🧭 Mental Model

|Concept|Composition direction|Data flow direction|
|---|---|---|
|`comp f g h`|Right to left|Right to left|
|`transduce (comp f g)`|Right to left (composition)|**Left to right** (data)|

---

### ✅ Final takeaway:

> **Always** think of `comp` as **right to left**.  
> In `transduce`, the **transformations apply in order of data flow**, so **read them left to right** for your sanity.  
> But it's still right-to-left composition under the hood.

Would you like to see a visual diagram for this flow? Or a hand-rolled `transduce` to see how it applies step by step?

# Explanation 2

Awesome — this is one of the **most subtle but important mental shifts** in Clojure's functional style. Let's **deep dive** into the tension between:

- `comp` being **right-to-left**
    
- data **flowing left-to-right** in `transduce`
    

---

## 🔁 First, Let's Understand `comp`



`(comp f g h) ;; => means (f (g (h x)))`

This is **classic composition**: right to left.  
The function on the **right runs first**, and its output is passed to the one on its **left**.



`((comp str inc) 2)  ;; => (str (inc 2)) => "3"`

---

## ⚙️ But `transduce` Feels "Left-to-Right"



`(transduce (comp (map inc) (filter even?)) conj [] [1 2 3]) ;; => [2 4]`

Here’s where the confusion comes in:

You see:

- `(map inc)` written **before** `(filter even?)`
    
- Yet, logically you're thinking:  
    → map inc → then filter even?  
    → inc makes odd into even → then filter
    

You **read it left to right** and it makes sense.

---

### 🧠 So What’s Really Happening?

Let's **pull back the curtain**.


`(comp (map inc) (filter even?))`

This composes **transducers**, not regular functions.

Each **transducer** takes a **reducing function** and returns a new one:

```clojure
(map inc) ; returns a function: (fn [rf] ...)
(filter even?) ; also returns a function: (fn [rf] ...)

```

So this:


`(comp (map inc) (filter even?))`

Means:


`(map inc) applies to the result of (filter even?)`

i.e.,

`(map inc) ∘ (filter even?) → inc happens **after** filter`

But wait! That’s **opposite** to how you **think** about it 🤯.

---

## 💡 That’s Why You Should "Read Left to Right" in `transduce`

Even though `comp` is right-to-left **by definition**, when you use it in `transduce`, **the order of data flow is left to right**.

Clojure authors intentionally tell you:

> For **your sanity**, read `(comp (map f) (filter p))` as  
> data → map f → filter p

Even though under the hood it's:


`(map f) wraps (filter p)`

So `filter` actually happens **first** at the lower level, but logically, you think:

1. data is mapped
    
2. then filtered
    

Because **that’s how the data flows**.

---

## 🧪 Visual Walkthrough

```clojure
(transduce
  (comp (map inc) (filter even?)) ;; Think: data → inc → filter
  conj
  []
  [1 2 3 4])

```

1. `[1 2 3 4]`
    
2. `map inc`: → `[2 3 4 5]`
    
3. `filter even?`: → `[2 4]`
    
4. `conj into []`: → `[2 4]`
    

So always:

> **Write `(comp A B C)` like a pipeline: A → B → C**

But remember:

> Under the hood: `A (B (C rf))`

So still **right-to-left composition** of _transformations_, but **left-to-right in terms of data**.

---

## 🔄 Analogy

Think of:


`(comp map-step filter-step reduce-step)`

as:


`map → filter → reduce`

You are **building a data processing pipeline**, so it's natural to think:

> First we `map`, then `filter`, then `reduce`.

That’s how the data **flows**, even if the code composes them in reverse behind the scenes.

---

## ✅ Final Tip

When writing transducers:

- Don't worry about right-to-left.
    
- Just **write transformations in data-flow order** inside `comp`.
    


`(comp   (map parse-int)   (filter even?)   (map inc)) ;; Think: parse-int → filter even → inc`

This is the **big mind shift**:  
You **write transformations in order**, but the **composition is still functional**.
