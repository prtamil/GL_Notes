can you explain reify and clojure.lang.IReduceInit how does it work what is reify

###### ChatGPT said:

Absolutely! Let's dive into `reify` and `clojure.lang.IReduceInit` — these are powerful, lower-level Clojure features that help you control how your objects behave.

---

## 🧪 What is `reify`?

`reify` creates an **anonymous object** that implements one or more **protocols or Java interfaces**.

Think of `reify` as:

> "Let me quickly define a thing that behaves like this interface/protocol."

It’s Clojure’s way to do quick, inline polymorphism — **no class needed**.

---

### 🔧 Basic Syntax:

```clojure
(reify
  SomeProtocol
  (some-method [this arg] ...)

  AnotherInterface
  (someJavaMethod [this arg1 arg2] ...))

```

---

## 🧠 What is `clojure.lang.IReduceInit`?

This is an internal Java interface from Clojure’s core:

```java
public interface IReduceInit {
  Object reduce(IFn f, Object start);
}

```

When you implement it, you make your object **reducible** — so Clojure’s `reduce` knows how to efficiently walk through your data without converting it to a seq.

This is what powers `eduction`, `range`, `repeat`, etc. to be faster and allocation-free.

---

### 🧪 Why not just use `seq`?

Because `seq` creates intermediate lazy sequences.

With `IReduceInit`, you **skip seq creation**, saving memory and CPU. It’s like:

- `seq` → lazy + composable but can be slow
    
- `IReduceInit` → composable + fast, but not a sequence
    

---

## 🔍 Real Example: Our `my-eduction`

Let’s break it again:

```clojure
(defn my-eduction [xform coll]
  (reify
    clojure.lang.IReduceInit
    (reduce [_ rf init]
      (reduce (xform rf) init coll))))

```

1. **`reify`**: defines an object that knows how to reduce itself
    
2. **Implements `IReduceInit`**: so Clojure can call `(reduce reducible rf init)`
    
3. **When reduced**: it transforms the reducer via the transducer (`xform rf`), and then reduces over `coll`
    

---

## 🧠 Visualization

```clojure
(def my-thing
  (reify clojure.lang.IReduceInit
    (reduce [_ rf init]
      (reduce rf init [1 2 3]))))

(reduce + my-thing)
;; => 6

```

Boom — your own custom reducible thing!
