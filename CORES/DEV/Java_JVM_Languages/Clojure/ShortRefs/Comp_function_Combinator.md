In Clojure, `comp` is a **function composition** utility. It takes multiple functions as arguments and returns a new function that is the composition of those functions.
remember comp behaves differently
normal Left -> Right 
transducer Right -> Left

---

### **Definition**

`(comp f g h)`

Returns a function such that:


`((comp f g h) x)  ;; is the same as: (f (g (h x)))`

So the functions are applied **right to left**.

---

### **Parameters & Arity**

- **`comp` accepts any number of functions** as arguments: from zero to many.
    
- The **resulting function's arity depends on the rightmost function** (i.e., the last one passed to `comp`).
    

#### Special Cases:

- `(comp)` returns the **identity function**:

    `((comp) 42) ;=> 42`
    
- If the last function takes multiple args, the composed function also takes those many args:
    
    `((comp str +) 1 2 3) ;=> "6" ;; (+ 1 2 3) => 6, then (str 6) => "6"`
    

---

### **Beautiful Example**

Let‚Äôs build a composed function that:

1. Takes a string of numbers like `"1,2,3"`
    
2. Converts it to a list of integers
    
3. Doubles each number
    
4. Sums the result
    

```clojure
(def process
  (comp
    str                ; convert result to string
    #(reduce + %)      ; sum the numbers
    #(map #(* 2 %) %)  ; double each number
    #(map read-string (clojure.string/split % #",")))) ; parse string to ints

(process "1,2,3") ;=> "12"

```

### Step-by-step:

- `"1,2,3"` ‚Üí `["1" "2" "3"]`
    
- ‚Üí `[1 2 3]` (with `read-string`)
    
- ‚Üí `[2 4 6]` (with `(* 2 x)`)
    
- ‚Üí `12` (with `reduce +`)
    
- ‚Üí `"12"` (with `str`)

Would you like a version that returns a vector of doubled numbers instead of a string sum? Or maybe something more visual like transforming image URLs or HTML strings?

So if comp last function I have 3 parama before last I have 4 parama and all function a I have 3 parama how to write

###### ChatGPT said:

Great question!

Let‚Äôs clarify how `comp` handles functions with multiple parameters, and how you can chain them when **all your functions take 3 parameters**.

---

### **Key rule in `comp`:**

Only the **last function** in the composition (the **rightmost**) gets the full arguments passed to the composed function.  
Every other function **must take a single argument**, which is the result of the function that comes after it.

---

### **Example Setup**

Let‚Äôs say you have 3 functions:
```clojure
(defn f3 [a b c] ...) ;; rightmost (will get 3 args)
(defn f2 [x] ...)     ;; gets 1 arg: the result of f3
(defn f1 [x] ...)     ;; gets 1 arg: result of f2

```

You write:

```clojure
(def composed (comp f1 f2 f3))
(composed 1 2 3) ;; => f1(f2(f3 1 2 3))

```

---

### **Your case: all functions take 3 arguments**

If **all 3 functions take 3 parameters**, then `comp` **won‚Äôt work directly**, because only the last function gets 3 arguments.

You have two options:

---

### **Option 1: Wrap other functions to make them unary**

Convert the outer functions into functions that take a single argument (e.g., a tuple or a map), so they can be composed.

```clojure
(defn f3 [a b c]
  [a b c]) ;; just returns args as vector

(defn f2 [[a b c]]
  [(* a 2) (* b 2) (* c 2)]) ;; doubles each

(defn f1 [[a b c]]
  (+ a b c)) ;; sums

(def composed (comp f1 f2 f3))
(composed 1 2 3) ;; => 12

```

---

### **Option 2: Use threading (`->` or `->>`) or direct nesting**

If all functions really need 3 separate args, consider nesting them manually:

```clojure
(f1 (f2 (f3 a b c)))

```

Or use the threading macro with destructuring:

```clojure
(->> (f3 a b c)
     f2
     f1)

```

---

### Summary

- `comp` expects: last function = variadic, others = unary
    
- If all functions take 3 args, you must **wrap** them to make intermediate ones **unary** (e.g., take a vector or map)
    
- Or, use threading/nesting for cleaner syntax

##### You said:

((comp str + ) 1 2 3) gives 6 but (+ (str 1 2 3)) throws error then how come comp works

###### ChatGPT said:

Awesome observation ‚Äî you're absolutely right to ask this! Let's unpack this carefully and you'll see why:

---

### üîç The core mystery:

You wrote:

`((comp str +) 1 2 3) ;; => "6"`

But:


`(+ (str 1 2 3)) ;; => ERROR!`

So why does `comp` work?

---

### ‚úÖ First, what does `(comp str +)` mean?

This creates a new function that:


`(fn [& args]   (str (+ args...)))`

When you call:


`((comp str +) 1 2 3)`

It works like this:

1. `+` is the **last** function passed to `comp`, so it gets **all the arguments** ‚Äî in this case: `(+ 1 2 3)` ‚Üí `6`
    
2. `str` is then called with the result: `(str 6)` ‚Üí `"6"`
    

So it becomes:

`(str (+ 1 2 3)) ;; => "6"`

That‚Äôs why it works!

---

### ‚ùå Why does `(+ (str 1 2 3))` fail?

Because here, **`str` runs first**, producing:


`(str 1 2 3) ;; => "123"`

Then it becomes:


`(+ "123") ;; ERROR! Can't add a string`

So this fails with:


`ClassCastException: java.lang.String cannot be cast to java.lang.Number`

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

|Expression|What happens|Result|
|---|---|---|
|`(comp str +)`|Composes `str` ‚àò `+`|Returns a new function|
|`((comp str +) 1 2 3)`|Runs `+` on args ‚Üí then `str`|`"6"`|
|`(+ (str 1 2 3))`|Runs `str` first ‚Üí then `+` fails|‚ùå Error|

---

### ‚ú® Bonus Tip

If you're ever unsure, you can expand the composed function with `macroexpand` or just manually inline the function calls to see what's really happening.


## Comp vs Comp with Transducers

 
	1. if it takes functions normal like +, sq, cube,  it behaves combined function and execute from right to left 
	2. if it takes transducers like map,filter,etc.  it behaves combined function and execute from left to right in presense of tranducer, into, etc..
