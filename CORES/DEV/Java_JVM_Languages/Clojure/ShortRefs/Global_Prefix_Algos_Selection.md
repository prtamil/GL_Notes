# 🧠 Mental Shortcut

- **`filter`/`remove`** → _global selection_  
    “Give me **all items** that (do / don’t) match a condition, no matter where they appear.”

- **`take-while`/`drop-while`** → _prefix trimming_  
    “Give me the **leading run** of items that satisfy a condition, stop at the first failure.”

# 🔹 What is “prefix trimming”?

In functional programming, a **prefix** of a sequence = everything from the **start up to some point**.

👉 `take-while` and `drop-while` **chop the sequence at the first point where the predicate fails**.

Example:
```clj
(take-while pos? [5 3 2 -1 0 4 7])
;; => (5 3 2)

(drop-while pos? [5 3 2 -1 0 4 7])
;; => (-1 0 4 7)

```

- `take-while` gave the **positive prefix** until it hit `-1`.
- `drop-while` removed that same prefix, leaving the rest.
    

Notice how later positives (`4 7`) are **ignored** by `take-while`.  
That’s why it’s **prefix trimming** — it only looks at the _leading run_.

# 🔹 Use Cases

### ✅ When to use `filter` / `remove` (global selection)

- Extracting items from anywhere in the data.
    
- Examples:
    
    - All odd numbers in a list
        
    - All users older than 18
        
    - All log entries containing `"ERROR"`
        

```clj
(filter odd? [1 2 3 4 5 6])
;; => (1 3 5)

```

### ✅ When to use `take-while` / `drop-while` (prefix trimming)

- When your data is **naturally ordered** and you only care about the **leading section until a cutoff point**.
    
- Examples:
    
    - Take numbers until you hit the first negative.
        
    - Drop leading blank lines from text.
        
    - Consume sensor readings while they are below a threshold.
        
```clj
(take-while #(< % 100) [10 20 30 150 200 50])
;; => (10 20 30)   ;; stops at 150

(drop-while clojure.string/blank? ["" "" "hello" "world"])
;; => ("hello" "world")

```

Here `drop-while` is trimming **prefix blanks**, not all blanks.

|Function|Operates On|Stops Early?|Behavior Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|`filter pred coll`|All items|❌ No|Picks all matches, anywhere|
|`remove pred coll`|All items|❌ No|Drops all matches, anywhere|
|`take-while pred coll`|Prefix only|✅ Yes|Takes items until first failure|
|`drop-while pred coll`|Prefix only|✅ Yes|Drops items until first failure|

👉 Quick intuition:

- If you imagine your sequence as a **line of people**:
    
    - `filter` = “Everyone raise your hand if you’re tall.” (all tall people, scattered).
        
    - `take-while` = “Line up at the front until the first short person shows up.” (prefix only).
