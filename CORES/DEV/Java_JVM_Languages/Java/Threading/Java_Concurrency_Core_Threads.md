### **Mastering Java Threads Without `java.util.concurrent` Framework**

If you want to master Java threads from the ground up without relying on `java.util.concurrent`, you'll need to understand the **core threading model**, **synchronization mechanisms**, and **memory visibility rules**. Here’s a structured roadmap:

---

## **1. Basics of Java Threads**

✅ **Creating Threads**

- Extending `Thread` class
- Implementing `Runnable` interface
- Creating anonymous threads with lambda expressions (`new Thread(() -> {...}).start()`)

✅ **Thread Lifecycle & States**

- **NEW** → **RUNNABLE** → **RUNNING** → **BLOCKED/WAITING** → **TERMINATED**
- Methods: `start()`, `sleep()`, `join()`, `yield()`, `interrupt()`, `isAlive()`

✅ **Daemon vs. User Threads**

- `setDaemon(true)` (for background tasks like garbage collection)

---

## **2. Thread Synchronization (Avoiding Race Conditions & Data Corruption)**

✅ **Intrinsic Locks (Monitor Locks)**

- `synchronized` keyword
- Synchronized methods: `synchronized void method() {}`
- Synchronized blocks: `synchronized (this) { ... }` (object-level locking)

✅ **Static Synchronization**

- `synchronized static void method() {}` (class-level locking)

✅ **Understanding Deadlocks & Starvation**

- Deadlock prevention using lock ordering
- Starvation (low-priority threads never getting CPU)

---

## **3. Thread Communication (Inter-Thread Coordination)**

✅ **Wait-Notify Mechanism**

- `wait()`, `notify()`, `notifyAll()`
- Requires `synchronized` block (monitors are required)
- Example: Implementing a producer-consumer problem

✅ **Busy-Waiting vs. Proper Synchronization**

- Avoid `while (!condition) {}`
- Prefer `wait()` and `notify()`

---

## **4. ThreadLocal (Per-Thread Data Storage)**

✅ **Understanding `ThreadLocal<T>`**

- Creates a separate variable copy for each thread
- Example: `ThreadLocal<Integer> localVar = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> 0);`

✅ **Use Cases of `ThreadLocal`**

- Storing user sessions in web applications
- Database connections per thread

✅ **Problems with `ThreadLocal`**

- Memory leaks if not removed (`remove()`)

---

## **5. Volatile & Memory Visibility**

✅ **Understanding `volatile`**

- Ensures visibility of changes across threads
- Does NOT provide atomicity (use `synchronized` or `AtomicXXX` instead)

✅ **When to Use `volatile`?**

- Ideal for flags (`volatile boolean running = true;`)
- Not for incrementing values (`x++` is not atomic)

✅ **Java Memory Model (JMM) Basics**

- Happens-before relationships
- Visibility & ordering rules

---

## **6. Thread Priorities & Yielding**

✅ **Thread Priority System (`setPriority()`)**

- **`Thread.MIN_PRIORITY (1) → Thread.NORM_PRIORITY (5) → Thread.MAX_PRIORITY (10)`**

✅ **Thread Yielding (`Thread.yield()`)**

- Hints to the scheduler that the thread is willing to pause

✅ **Context Switching & Performance Implications**

- Too many threads cause overhead due to context switching

---

## **7. Interrupts & Stopping Threads Safely**

✅ **Interrupt Mechanism**

- `thread.interrupt()` vs. `Thread.interrupted()`
- Properly handling `InterruptedException`
- Example: Stopping a running thread safely

✅ **Why `stop()` is Deprecated?**

- Can leave objects in an inconsistent state

---

## **8. Multi-Threaded Programming Without `java.util.concurrent`**

✅ **Manual Implementation of Thread Pool**

- Create a worker thread queue
- Dispatch tasks manually

✅ **Building a Simple Producer-Consumer Model**

- Using only `synchronized`, `wait()`, and `notify()`.

✅ **Implementing a Simple Mutex Lock Using `synchronized`**

- Prevent concurrent access to a shared resource

---

## **9. Advanced Concepts**

✅ **Reentrant Locks Without `java.util.concurrent.locks`**

- Implement a reentrant lock using `synchronized`

✅ **Building a Simple Read-Write Lock**

- Implement read-write separation manually

✅ **Implementing a Simple Thread Barrier**

- Synchronizing multiple threads to wait at a common point

---

## **Final Thoughts**

By mastering these core thread-related topics, you can **fully understand** Java’s threading model **without** relying on the `java.util.concurrent` package. Once you're comfortable, you can transition into using **higher-level concurrency tools** for better performance and code clarity.
