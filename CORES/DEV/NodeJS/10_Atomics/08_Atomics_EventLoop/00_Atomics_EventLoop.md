# Atomics + Event Loop (JS-Specific)

## Why This Level Is Special

Most languages have:

- threads
    
- atomics
    
- schedulers
    

**JavaScript is different**.

JS has:

- a **single-threaded event loop**
    
- **async tasks**
    
- **workers with shared memory**
    

This means:

> **Concurrency happens _around_ the event loop, not inside it.**

Atomics are how you **bridge those worlds safely**.

---

## The Big Picture

JS concurrency looks like this:

```js
Event Loop (main thread)
        ↑
 Atomics + Shared Memory
        ↓
   Worker Threads

```

Workers do:

- CPU-heavy work
    
- coordination
    
- scheduling decisions
    

Event loop does:

- async I/O
    
- promise resolution
    
- callbacks
    

Atomics are the **contract** between them.

---

## Why This Is Hard (and Powerful)

The event loop:

- must never block
    
- must stay responsive
    

Workers:

- can block
    
- can wait
    
- can spin (carefully)
    

So the rule is:

> **Block in workers. Signal the event loop. Never the other way around.**

Atomics make that possible.

---

## Core Pattern: Signal, Don’t Poll

### Bad idea

```js
eventLoop:
  while (!workAvailable) {}

```

Kills JS.

### Correct idea

```js
worker:
  publish work
  atomic notify

eventLoop:
  react when notified

```

The event loop **reacts**, it never waits.

---

## Atomic Queues + Event Loop

A common structure:

```js
Shared Queue (Atomics)
     ↓
 Worker pushes work
     ↓
 Main thread schedules async callback

```

The queue lives in shared memory.  
The execution happens via the event loop.

This separation is crucial.

---

## Example: Async Task Scheduler (Conceptual)

### Worker side

```js
push task into shared queue
atomic notify

```

### Event loop side

```js
on notification:
  drain queue
  schedule tasks via setImmediate / Promise

```

Atomics handle **coordination**.  
Event loop handles **execution order**.

---

## Priority Queues (JS Flavor)

Workers:

- push tasks with priority
    
- do heavy ordering work
    

Main thread:

- pops highest priority
    
- schedules execution
    

Why?  
Because sorting in workers keeps:

- event loop fast
    
- UI / server responsive
    

Atomics ensure:

- safe publication
    
- visibility
    
- correctness
    

---

## Work Stealing (Very Important)

Work stealing fits JS surprisingly well.

### Model

```js
Each worker has local queue
Idle worker steals from others

```

Why it works in JS:

- Workers can block
    
- Atomics coordinate ownership
    
- Event loop stays untouched
    

The event loop:

- doesn’t know
    
- doesn’t care
    
- just executes tasks
    

---

## State Machines + Event Loop

This is where **Level 5 comes back**.

Event loop often checks:

```js
if (state !== RUNNING) return

```

Workers transition state:

- INIT → RUNNING
    
- RUNNING → DRAINING
    
- DRAINING → CLOSED
    

This lets you:

- stop scheduling safely
    
- drain tasks
    
- shut down cleanly
    

No locks. No races.

---

## Why JS Becomes a Systems Language Here

Because JS now controls:

- memory visibility
    
- scheduling
    
- lifecycle
    
- concurrency boundaries
    

Not just “callbacks”.

This is **runtime engineering**, not scripting.

---

## Real Systems That Use This Pattern

### Node.js core

- Worker pool
    
- Streams
    
- Async hooks
    
- Graceful shutdown
    

### Browsers

- Web Workers
    
- Rendering pipelines
    
- Task prioritization
    

### Server frameworks

- Job schedulers
    
- Background queues
    
- Rate-limited async work
    

---

## The Deep Insight (Read Carefully)

> **JS is not single-threaded.  
> Only the _event loop_ is.**

Atomics let you:

- coordinate outside the loop
    
- feed it work safely
    
- never block it
    

That’s the power.

---

## Common Mistakes

❌ Blocking the event loop with Atomics.wait  
❌ Doing heavy CAS loops on main thread  
❌ Mixing async promises with shared-state mutation  
❌ Forgetting visibility boundaries

Good designs:

- isolate workers
    
- keep main thread reactive
    
- use atomics as signals, not locks
    

---

## How Everything Connects

You’ve now seen:

- Mutexes → correctness
    
- Conditions → coordination
    
- Barriers → phases
    
- RW locks → performance
    
- Lock-free reads → scalability
    
- State machines → lifecycle
    
- Shards → throughput
    
- Event loop → execution
    

This is a **complete mental model**.

---

## Final Takeaway (The Real One)

> **JS becomes a systems language when you stop blocking it  
> and start orchestrating it.**

Atomics are not for “threads”.  
They are for **designing runtimes**.
