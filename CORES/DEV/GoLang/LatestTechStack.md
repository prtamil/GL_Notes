# TechStack Suggestions
## 2023-August
  

- Chi for routing
    
- Cobra for commands (even for webservers, I add a `serve` command)
    
- Viper for configuration
    
- Pulumi (infrastructure as code, when needed)
    
- oapi-codegen (OpenAPI)
    
- zap (logging)
    
- pterm (CLI display/logging tool)
    

For almost everything else, I just use the standard library or the most popular libraries, like redigo for Redis or pgx for Postgres.
