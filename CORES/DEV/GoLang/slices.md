Slices is vector equivalent its complex characteristic and it takes time to master.
so dont think slice as python slice equivalent.

## chap 4 Array / Slice :Go programming language book

Array

1. Fixed Size
2. Compares only samesize+sametype+samevalue
3. go func pass by values. array pass by value :costly
4. use ptr to pass by values but pass refernces :Cheap
5. no dynamic add . only fixed size.
