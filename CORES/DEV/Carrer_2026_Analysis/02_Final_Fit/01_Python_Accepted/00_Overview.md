**Senior Backend Systems Engineer (Python + Linux + Performance)**

Senior Backend Systems Engineer (Python)  
Performance • Distributed Systems • Platform & Infrastructure Engineering

Senior engineer with 20+ years of experience building high-performance systems across backend platforms, embedded environments, and browser-based compute-heavy applications. Deep expertise in Python backend architecture, asynchronous systems, performance optimization, and infrastructure automation, with a strong foundation in Linux, C/C++, and cloud-native deployments.

Primary strengths include designing scalable backend services, solving complex performance bottlenecks, building automation platforms, and working across system layers — from low-level networking and data pipelines to modern web and GPU-accelerated interfaces.

Backend & Systems Expertise:  
• 10+ years production experience in Python backend engineering using FastAPI, Django, Django REST, and SQLAlchemy  
• Strong knowledge of concurrency models, async event loops, generators, and advanced Python internals (metaclasses, dunder methods)  
• Built real-time data migration pipelines (MySQL → PostgreSQL) using WAL-based streaming and transactional processing  
• Experience designing scalable services using RabbitMQ, Airflow, and event-driven architectures  
• Infrastructure automation using Paramiko, Netmiko, and custom system tooling  
• Containerized deployments using Docker and Kubernetes

Performance & Platform Engineering:  
• Extensive experience diagnosing and fixing production performance bottlenecks across backend and frontend systems  
• Strong Linux systems background with C/C++ exposure from embedded and device-level environments  
• Hands-on experience in system-level debugging, profiling, and reliability engineering  
• Built automation platforms and internal engineering tools for large-scale operational workflows

Advanced Web Engineering:  
• Strong JavaScript expertise with React and modern web platforms  
• High-performance graphics engineering using WebGL/WebGPU  
• Experience solving rendering bottlenecks, memory constraints, and real-time UI performance issues in compute-heavy applications

Core Identity:  
A systems-focused backend engineer with cross-stack depth, strong debugging instincts, and real production battle scars across backend, infrastructure, and performance-critical environments. Proven ability to design reliable platforms, optimize complex systems, and deliver scalable solutions in engineering-driven organizations.

Primary Languages: Python, JavaScript  
Systems Foundation: Linux, C/C++  
Platforms: Docker, Kubernetes, Distributed Services, Async Architectures

If you want something tighter for job portals:

**Option 1**  
Senior Backend Systems Engineer | Python | Distributed Systems | Performance & Platform Engineering

**Option 2**  
Senior Python Backend Engineer | Scalable Systems | Infra & Performance Specialist

**Option 3**  
Backend Platform Engineer (Python) | Async Systems | Cloud-Native | Performance Optimization

## Important strategic note

This profile:

- Uses Python as anchor
    
- Uses JS as strength
    
- Uses systems/performance as differentiator
    

This makes you:

- Hard to replace
    
- Hard to compare
    
- Hard to ignore
    

And that’s exactly where a 20-year engineer should sit.
