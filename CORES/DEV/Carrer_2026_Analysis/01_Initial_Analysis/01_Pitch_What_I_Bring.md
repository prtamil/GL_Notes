# What I Bring as a Systems / Platform Engineer

_(Built for disciplined spending, real customers, and long-term systems)_

---

## 1️⃣ I build systems that survive real usage — without burning money

I specialize in **backend and platform systems that remain stable, efficient, and predictable as usage grows**.

I build systems that:

- Have **clear failure modes**
    
- Scale **incrementally**, not expensively
    
- Stay understandable under pressure
    

I work across **Go, Node.js, and Python**, choosing each deliberately:

- **Go** for **high-throughput, low-latency microservices, platform services, and performance-critical paths**
    
- **Node.js** for **event-driven APIs, real-time systems, and integration layers**
    
- **Python** for **workflows, orchestration, automation, and data-heavy services**
    

If your product is past the “toy stage” and **reliability + cost control** matter, I can own that layer end-to-end.

---

## 2️⃣ I think in SLAs, SLOs, and cost — not frameworks

I don’t start with tools.  
I start with **business expectations**.

- Latency targets
    
- Throughput assumptions
    
- Failure isolation
    
- Degradation and backpressure strategies
    
- Cost impact of scaling decisions
    

From there, I design the **simplest architecture that meets today’s needs** and won’t collapse tomorrow.

I actively avoid:

- Premature microservices
    
- Over-engineered abstractions
    
- “Scale-first” designs without traffic
    

I will say **no** when complexity doesn’t justify its cost.

---

## 3️⃣ I make security a default, not a future rewrite

I bring **practical, embedded application security**—not checkbox compliance.

- OAuth2 / OpenID Connect
    
- SSO and Keycloak-based IAM
    
- Secure multi-tenant architecture
    
- OWASP-aware API design
    
- Rate limiting, auth boundaries, token strategies
    

This protects:

- Customer trust
    
- Enterprise deals
    
- Future audits
    
- Your team’s time
    

Security is treated as **revenue and reputation protection**, not an afterthought.

---

## 4️⃣ I debug what others struggle to see

When things break in production, I’m effective and calm.

- CPU, memory, and I/O profiling
    
- Tracing async and distributed flows
    
- Root cause analysis under pressure
    
- Debugging across code, runtime, containers, and cloud infrastructure
    

In tight budgets, **fast diagnosis and recovery** matter more than perfect architecture.  
That’s where I’m strongest.

---

## 5️⃣ I build high-performance web frontends when performance actually matters

I’m not a general UI developer.

I work on **performance-critical frontends**:

- GPU-accelerated systems (Three.js, WebGL2, WebGPU)
    
- Real-time dashboards and visualization
    
- Streaming UIs and live systems
    
- Frame-rate, memory, and rendering optimization
    

If your product involves **visualization, simulation, or real-time interaction**, this becomes a serious differentiator—not a nice-to-have.

---

## 6️⃣ I’m hands-on, pragmatic, and collaborative

I don’t just design systems—I work inside them.

- I write and review production code
    
- I mentor without gatekeeping
    
- I unblock teams instead of creating dependencies
    
- I prefer clarity over hierarchy
    

I adapt to the company stage:

- Scrappy when needed
    
- Disciplined when scaling begins
    

---

## What I Don’t Do (By Design)

- I’m not a pure UI/UX designer
    
- I’m not an ML research engineer
    
- I don’t build hype-driven architectures
    
- I don’t over-engineer early MVPs
    

I focus on **systems that work, scale safely, and stay affordable**.

---

## Best Fit

I’m most effective in companies that:

- Are past MVP or approaching real scale
    
- Care about **reliability, security, and cost control**
    
- Build **B2B or infrastructure-heavy products**
    
- Want someone who can **own backend / platform complexity**
    
- Value long-term system health over short-term velocity theatre
    

---

## Bottom Line

If you want someone who can **design, build, debug, secure, and scale systems**—  
while keeping costs, risk, and complexity under control—  
that’s what I bring.

### Final coach note (important)

This version:

- Aligns perfectly with **disciplined capital**
    
- Makes Go a **strength, not a restriction**
    
- De-risks you in founder/CTO conversations
    
- Clearly signals **“I protect your business”**
    

If you want next, I can:

- Compress this into a **30-second verbal pitch**
    
- Adapt it for **Indian enterprise recruiters**
    
- Create **two variants** (Platform-heavy / Backend-heavy)
    
- Tune it for **email vs live call usage**
