**Brutal honesty — full 6 months full-time prep after layoff from fullstack/arch role.**

You have **6 months full-time** (realistic ~1000–1200 productive hours if you're disciplined). At 46, 23 years experience, current 25L salary, strong production WebGPU/perf depth, Keycloak/Istio/OWASP basics, recent Rust start, Python/K8s scaling background — you're pivoting to **senior DevSecOps / Cloud AppSec + Performance / SRE** roles (India/remote, target 35–55L+).

The question: **Full cert path** vs **full blog/tools/POCs path** — which is best?

**Short brutal answer**:  
**Hybrid wins: 60–70% on high-impact POC + visibility (blogs/LinkedIn/posts) + 30–40% on one strong cert.**  

Pure "full cert" (multiple exams, no public proof) = medium effect, high risk of staying invisible/underpaid.  
Pure "full POC/blog" = higher effect for seniors like you **if executed publicly and aggressively**, but slower initial traction and more rejection from ATS/certs-keyword filters.

From 2026 India market data (Naukri/LinkedIn trends, salary reports, hiring insights):
- **Certifications** give quick keyword wins (ATS passes, recruiter trust, 10–30% salary bump reported for AWS Security Specialty in cloud/security roles).
- **Portfolio/POCs + public writing** prove currency + depth (especially for 40+ seniors) — hands-on projects + blogs beat certs alone for mid-senior DevSecOps/SRE hires in product/GCC/fintech companies.
- Most realistic path for salary jump from 25L: **Cert + visible POC** combo. Pure one or the other leaves gaps.

**Comparison Table (2026 India/remote senior DevSecOps/SRE/Cloud Perf/AppSec reality)**

| Path                          | Probability of 35L+ offer in 6 months | Salary Impact (from 25L) | Speed to Interviews | Risk for You (46yo, laid off) | Boredom Fit (INTP) | Why It Wins/Loses for You |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **Full Cert Only** (e.g., AWS Security Specialty + maybe CKS or GCP Sec) | 50–65%                               | +10–25L (common bump)   | Fast (2–3 months)  | High (no proof you're "current" beyond badge; age bias hits harder) | Medium–High (exam grind repetitive) | Certs get screens, but interviews ask "show me" → weak without POC |
| **Full POC/Blog/Tools Only** (deep public repo + 8–12 LinkedIn posts/blogs) | 60–75%                               | +15–35L (if viral/engaged) | Medium–Slow (3–5 months to traction) | Medium (strong proof beats age if visible; risk of low engagement) | Low (novel building + writing = engaging) | Best differentiation; market says projects > certs for seniors |
| **Hybrid (Recommended)**: 60–70% POC/visibility + 30–40% one cert | **70–85%**                           | +15–35L+                | Balanced (cert early screens + POC closes) | Low (covers ATS + proves depth) | Balanced (mix grind + creative) | Maximizes your strengths: depth + systems thinking |

**Why hybrid is best for your situation**
- You already have **real production scars** (23 years + recent WebGPU year) — cert alone won't add much "wow".
- Market 2026: Cloud security/DevSecOps roles value **AWS/GCP security certs** highly (frequent in JDs, salary reports show ₹12–18L+ for holders in mid-senior).
- But for seniors pivoting: **GitHub + blogs/LinkedIn series** = stronger signal of modernity (many reports: "projects prove capability", "portfolio that shows you can ship").
- 6 months full-time = enough for **one cert + killer POC + consistent visibility** without burnout.

**Recommended 6-Month Full-Time Roadmap (Hybrid – Optimized for You)**

**Months 1–2: Cert Foundation + POC Base (Fast Cred + Momentum)**
- Primary focus: **AWS Certified Security – Specialty** (or GCP if you prefer; AWS dominates India).
  - Why: Broad appeal, covers IAM/zero-trust (your Keycloak strength), cloud controls, incident response — recruiter magnet.
  - Prep: 8–10 weeks (your cloud/K8s base = fast track). Use A Cloud Guru/Adrian Cantrill + practice exams.
  - Pass by end Month 2 → add to LinkedIn/resume immediately.
- Parallel: Upgrade solar LLM/FastAPI POC repo publicly.
  - Add Trivy/Snyk/Grype scanning + SBOM + OPA policies + Istio mTLS enforcement.
  - Integrate OpenTelemetry + Prometheus alerts.
  - Post 1–2 LinkedIn updates/week: "Adding automated vuln scanning to my production-grade LLM backend".

**Months 3–4: Deep Differentiation + Visibility**
- POC evolution:
  - Add Rust component (Axum/Tokio worker for perf-critical part).
  - Basic eBPF tracing (libbpf-rs or bpftrace on your service).
  - k6 chaos/load tests + threat modeling doc.
  - Full README + architecture diagrams + before/after metrics.
- Blog/LinkedIn series (4–6 pieces):
  - Deep-dive posts: "Zero-trust in FastAPI with Keycloak + Istio", "eBPF for API observability", "Why Rust for safe perf in cloud backends at 46".
  - Aim: 1 post every 10–14 days, engage communities (DevSecOps, Rust, K8s groups).

**Months 5–6: Application Engine + Polish**
- Apply 15–20 tailored apps/week (GCCs, fintech, MSPs, cleantech).
  - Every app includes: POC link + specific feature matching JD + cert badge.
- More visibility: Short videos (Loom) of POC walkthroughs, comment on industry posts.
- Mock interviews: Focus on system design (secure/perf cloud systems), your war stories, Rust trajectory.

**Expected realistic outcome**
- With hybrid execution: 3–6 solid interviews/month by Month 5, likely 1–2 offers at 35–50L+ (or remote higher).
- Pure cert: Faster screens but weaker closes.
- Pure POC: Slower start but stronger "hire me now" pull if it gains traction.

**Final brutal call**  
**Do the hybrid.**  
Your INTP brain will hate pure cert grind but love building/showing in public.  
6 months is plenty — treat it like a paid project.  
Skip hybrid and go pure one side → you risk either "cert collector with no proof" or "invisible genius with great repo but no ATS hits".

Start **today**: Book the AWS Security exam date + clean/publicize your POC repo.
