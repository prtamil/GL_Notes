# üéØ Designing Rectangular Grids and Evenly Spacing Objects (Ellipses) Using Normalized Coordinates and Lerp

## üß† Introduction

When designing generative art or UI elements, one of the most fundamental layouts is the **rectangular grid** ‚Äî a set of evenly spaced points laid out in rows and columns across a 2D area, like a canvas or a screen.
This layout serves as the **scaffold** for placing shapes (like ellipses, squares, text, or icons) in a **systematic**, **aesthetically balanced**, and **parameter-controlled** way.
The goal of this essay is to help you understand:

- How to **design a grid from scratch**
- How to **evenly place objects** without overlap
- How to **control density, spacing, and object size**
- How to use **normalized coordinates** (`0.0` to `1.0`) for resolution independence
- How to **scale positions** using **linear interpolation (`lerp`)**
- How to tweak parameters and **predict visual outcomes**

## üß± Part 1: The Concept of a Rectangular Grid

Imagine a rectangle divided into equal rows and columns. The points where rows and columns intersect are our **grid points**.

If you want to generate `cols` columns and `rows` rows, you are essentially laying out a **2D matrix** of points.

---

## üî¢ Part 2: Normalized Coordinates (0.0 to 1.0)

Instead of using absolute pixel values directly, we use **normalized ratios** between `0.0` and `1.0`. This gives us **resolution independence** ‚Äî your grid will work whether your canvas is `500x500` or `1920x1080`.

### üëâ Example

For 5 points across the X axis:


`ratios_x = [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]`

Same applies to Y axis for rows.

### ‚úÖ General Formula


`ratios = [i / (count - 1) for i in 0 to count - 1]`

---

## üìê Part 3: Mapping to Actual Coordinates using Lerp

Once we have these normalized values, we can **map them to screen positions** using **linear interpolation (lerp)**:

pseudocode

CopyEdit

`x = lerp(margin_left, canvas_width - margin_right, rx) `
`y = lerp(margin_top, canvas_height - margin_bottom, ry)`

Where:

- `rx` and `ry` are normalized ratios (`0.0` to `1.0`)
    
- `lerp(a, b, t)` = `a + (b - a) * t` ‚Äî moves from `a` to `b` by `t`
    

This lets you scale any value between a start and end bound.

---

## üîÅ Part 4: Pseudocode to Generate Grid Points

```js
function generate_grid(canvas_width, canvas_height, cols, rows, margin):

    points = []
    for i from 0 to cols - 1:
        rx = i / (cols - 1)
        x = lerp(margin, canvas_width - margin, rx)

        for j from 0 to rows - 1:
            ry = j / (rows - 1)
            y = lerp(margin, canvas_height - margin, ry)

            points.append((x, y))

    return points

```

This will return a list of `(x, y)` positions spaced evenly across the canvas within the specified margins.

---

## üßÆ Part 5: Evenly Spacing Ellipses (No Overlap)

Now that you have grid points, you want to draw ellipses at those positions ‚Äî but they **should not touch**.

### üëâ Spacing Calculation

Let‚Äôs calculate how far apart the ellipses are spaced:


`x_spacing = (canvas_width - 2 * margin) / (cols - 1)
`y_spacing = (canvas_height - 2 * margin) / (rows - 1)`

To prevent overlap:


`diameter = min(x_spacing, y_spacing) * fill_ratio`

Where `fill_ratio` is between `0.0` (no size) and `1.0` (fills entire cell). Typical value is `0.6`‚Äì`0.8`.

---

## üé® Part 6: Drawing the Ellipses

```js
for (x, y) in points:
    draw_ellipse(center_x=x, center_y=y, width=diameter, height=diameter)

```

---

## üéöÔ∏è Part 7: Parameters and Their Effects

|Parameter|Description|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|`cols`|Number of grid columns|More columns = tighter horizontal spacing|
|`rows`|Number of grid rows|More rows = tighter vertical spacing|
|`margin`|Border space|Prevents shapes from being clipped|
|`fill_ratio`|How much space ellipse takes in each cell|Higher = bigger ellipses, risk of overlap|
|`canvas_width` / `canvas_height`|Screen size|Affects spacing calculations|

---

## üß™ Part 8: Example Grid Configurations and Results

|Config|Outcome|
|---|---|
|`cols = 5`, `rows = 5`, `fill_ratio = 0.7`|Medium grid, well spaced|
|`cols = 10`, `rows = 10`, `fill_ratio = 0.9`|Dense grid, likely touching|
|`cols = 3`, `rows = 3`, `fill_ratio = 0.3`|Sparse grid, lots of white space|

---

## üìè Part 9: Bonus ‚Äî Non-Square Ellipses

If you want **ellipses that are not perfect circles**, you can scale width and height separately using:


`draw_ellipse(x, y, diameter * x_scale, diameter * y_scale)`

For stretched ovals or other effects.

---

## üß≠ Summary

You now have a **complete mental model** and **design recipe** for generating a 2D grid of points, and placing ellipses (or any objects) evenly on them with full control over:

- Number of points
    
- Layout size
    
- Margins
    
- Object size
    
- Overlap behavior
    

All while using **normalized values** for adaptability and precision.

### Psuedo Code 
Here is **clear, structured pseudocode** for generating and drawing a **2D rectangular grid** of points using the following parameters:

### ‚úÖ Parameters

- `cols`: Number of columns (as normalized steps from 0.0 to 1.0)
    
- `rows`: Number of rows (as normalized steps from 0.0 to 1.0)
    
- `margin`: Space to leave on all sides of the canvas (in pixels)
    
- `xspacing`, `yspacing`: Extra space between points (in pixels), if you want to override the default evenly-spaced layout

## üìê Pseudocode for Grid with Normalized Points, Margin, and Spacing

```py
function lerp(a, b, t):
    return a + (b - a) * t

function generate_grid(canvas_width, canvas_height, cols, rows, margin, xspacing, yspacing):
    points = []

    // 1. Compute usable width and height
    usable_width = canvas_width - 2 * margin
    usable_height = canvas_height - 2 * margin

    // 2. Loop over grid ratios
    for col in 0 to cols - 1:
        rx = col / (cols - 1)       // Normalized ratio 0.0 to 1.0
        x = lerp(margin, margin + usable_width, rx) + (xspacing * col)

        for row in 0 to rows - 1:
            ry = row / (rows - 1)   // Normalized ratio 0.0 to 1.0
            y = lerp(margin, margin + usable_height, ry) + (yspacing * row)

            points.append((x, y))

    return points

```

## üß† How It Works

- `lerp(margin, margin + usable_width, rx)` maps the normalized `rx` to actual x position within margins.
    
- Similarly for `ry ‚Üí y`.
    
- `xspacing * col` adds extra space between columns (optional).
    
- `yspacing * row` adds extra space between rows (optional).

## üéØ Optional Usage Example

```py
canvas_width = 800
canvas_height = 600
cols = 6
rows = 4
margin = 50
xspacing = 0   // Can be set to add more horizontal gap
yspacing = 0   // Can be set to add more vertical gap

points = generate_grid(canvas_width, canvas_height, cols, rows, margin, xspacing, yspacing)

for (x, y) in points:
    draw_ellipse(x, y, width=20, height=20)

```
