# Designing an Arithmetic Spiral: Concepts, Formulas, and Pseudocode

An **arithmetic spiral** (also known as an Archimedean spiral) is a beautiful geometric curve that starts at a center point and "spirals outwards" with a radius that increases linearly with the angle. This spiral pattern is common in nature (snail shells, galaxies, flowers) and is used widely in computer graphics and procedural art.

This essay explains how to design points placed along an arithmetic spiral, the key formulas involved, and how you can control parameters to shape the spiral’s appearance. The explanation uses fundamental trigonometry concepts — sine, cosine, and circles — with clear pseudocode to help you create spiral point distributions.

## Understanding the Arithmetic Spiral

### What is an Arithmetic Spiral?

Unlike a circle (where radius is fixed), an arithmetic spiral’s radius `r` grows proportionally to the angle `θ`. Mathematically:

`r = a + b * θ`

- `a` is the initial radius (often 0, meaning the spiral starts at the center)
    
- `b` is the **spacing factor** — it controls how tightly or loosely the spiral coils
    
- `θ` (theta) is the angle in radians — it increases as you move along the spiral
    

As `θ` increases, `r` grows linearly, producing evenly spaced loops around the center.

## From Polar to Cartesian Coordinates

To plot points on a spiral, convert polar coordinates `(r, θ)` to Cartesian coordinates `(x, y)`:



`x = cx + r * cos(θ)`
`y = cy + r * sin(θ)`

Where `(cx, cy)` is the center of the spiral.

## How to Generate Points on the Spiral

You generate points by incrementing the angle `θ` step by step and calculating each point's radius and position.

## Pseudocode for Generating Arithmetic Spiral Points

```pseudocode
function generate_arithmetic_spiral(cx, cy, a, b, max_angle, angle_step):
    points = []
    
    for theta from 0 to max_angle step angle_step:
        r = a + b * theta
        x = cx + r * cos(theta)
        y = cy + r * sin(theta)
        points.append((x, y))
    
    return points

```
### Explanation:

- `cx, cy` — center of the spiral
    
- `a` — initial radius offset (usually 0)
    
- `b` — spacing factor controlling loop distance
    
- `max_angle` — how far (in radians) the spiral extends
    
- `angle_step` — angular increment, controls point density along the spiral

## Tweaking Parameters and Their Effects

|Parameter|Description|Effect When Changed|
|---|---|---|
|`a`|Starting radius|Non-zero `a` shifts the spiral away from center|
|`b`|Distance between loops|Larger `b` → loops more spread out (looser spiral)|
|`max_angle`|Spiral length in radians|Larger → longer spiral with more loops|
|`angle_step`|Angular increment per point|Smaller → more points, smoother spiral|
|`cx, cy`|Spiral center position|Moves spiral position on the canvas|

## Visualizing the Spiral Growth

- As `θ` increases, radius grows linearly.
    
- Points move around the center in a circle but with increasing radius.
    
- Each loop of the spiral corresponds roughly to a `2π` increment in `θ`.

## Example: Generate Points for 5 Loops

```pseudocode
max_angle = 5 * 2 * PI  // 5 full rotations
angle_step = PI / 30    // 60 points per loop
a = 0                   // start at center
b = 10                  // 10 pixels between loops

points = generate_arithmetic_spiral(cx, cy, a, b, max_angle, angle_step)

```

This generates points that start at the center and spiral outward with 5 loops spaced 10 pixels apart.

## Summary

- An **arithmetic spiral** grows linearly in radius with angle.
    
- Use `r = a + b * θ` to calculate the radius for each angle.
    
- Convert polar `(r, θ)` to Cartesian `(x, y)` using sine and cosine.
    
- Increment angle `θ` in steps to generate points along the spiral.
    
- Tweak parameters `a`, `b`, `max_angle`, and `angle_step` to control spiral shape and point density.
