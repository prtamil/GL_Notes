In computer graphics, geometry can be represented using various mathematical frameworks, each tailored for specific tasks. Here’s an explanation of how these approaches work, and the ways they are used in ray tracing and graphics programming:

---

### 1. **Algebraic Representation**

- **How It Works**:  
    Geometry is expressed as equations or systems of equations. For instance:
    - A **plane**: ax+by+cz+d=0ax + by + cz + d = 0ax+by+cz+d=0
    - A **sphere**: (x−h)2+(y−k)2+(z−l)2−r2=0(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 + (z - l)^2 - r^2 = 0(x−h)2+(y−k)2+(z−l)2−r2=0
- **Usage**:
    - Efficiently checks relationships (e.g., a point is on a plane or inside a sphere).
    - Used in ray-object intersection tests (e.g., finding if a ray intersects a sphere).
- **Pros**: Compact and computationally efficient.
- **Cons**: Limited visualization and hard to manipulate complex shapes.

### 2. **Analytic (Parametric) Representation**

- **How It Works**:  
    Geometry is defined parametrically, using equations that express coordinates as functions of parameters. For example:
    - A **line**: P⃗(t)=P0⃗+td⃗\vec{P}(t) = \vec{P_0} + t\vec{d}P(t)=P0​​+td, where ttt is a parameter.
    - A **circle**: x=rcos⁡(t),y=rsin⁡(t)x = r\cos(t), y = r\sin(t)x=rcos(t),y=rsin(t) where ttt is the angle parameter.
- **Usage**:
    - Describes curves and surfaces like Bézier curves, B-splines, and NURBS.
    - Essential for ray tracing to calculate exact points of intersection and reflections.
- **Pros**: Excellent for representing smooth curves and surfaces.
- **Cons**: May require solving equations to find intersections.

### 3. **Vector Representation**

- **How It Works**:  
    Points, directions, and transformations are represented as vectors in space.
    - A **point**: P⃗=[x,y,z]\vec{P} = [x, y, z]P=[x,y,z].
    - A **normal vector**: Used to describe orientation of surfaces.
- **Usage**:
    - Represents rays (R⃗(t)=O⃗+tD⃗\vec{R}(t) = \vec{O} + t\vec{D}R(t)=O+tD).
    - Calculates normals for shading and reflections.
- **Pros**: Simple and versatile.
- **Cons**: Not inherently tied to shape equations.

### 4. **Matrix Representation**

- **How It Works**:  
    Geometry is transformed using matrix operations. Commonly used for scaling, rotation, and translation:
    - **Translation**: Adds a displacement vector.
    - **Rotation**: Multiplies by a rotation matrix.
    - **Scaling**: Multiplies by a scaling matrix.
- **Usage**:
    - Essential for scene transformations and viewing in ray tracing.
    - Homogeneous coordinates ([x,y,z,w][x, y, z, w][x,y,z,w]) extend matrices for affine transformations.
- **Pros**: Unified way to handle transformations.
- **Cons**: Indirect; requires conversion to other forms for ray-object tests.

### 5. **Implicit Representation**

- **How It Works**:  
    Geometry is defined as a field or implicit function f(x,y,z)=0f(x, y, z) = 0f(x,y,z)=0.
    - A sphere: f(x,y,z)=(x−h)2+(y−k)2+(z−l)2−r2=0f(x, y, z) = (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 + (z - l)^2 - r^2 = 0f(x,y,z)=(x−h)2+(y−k)2+(z−l)2−r2=0.
- **Usage**:
    - Ray-object intersection tests (e.g., a ray hits a sphere when f(R⃗(t))=0f(\vec{R}(t)) = 0f(R(t))=0).
    - Volume rendering and constructive solid geometry (CSG).
- **Pros**: Flexible and easy to calculate intersections.
- **Cons**: Limited in describing complex surfaces.

### 6. **Discrete (Mesh) Representation**

- **How It Works**:  
    Geometry is represented by vertices, edges, and faces.
    - Example: A triangle is defined by three vertices V⃗1,V⃗2,V⃗3\vec{V}_1, \vec{V}_2, \vec{V}_3V1​,V2​,V3​.
- **Usage**:
    - Used in real-time rendering and ray tracing (triangle meshes dominate modern 3D graphics).
    - Enables efficient computation using spatial data structures like BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchies).
- **Pros**: Universally supported and versatile.
- **Cons**: Can only approximate curved surfaces.

### 7. **Functional Representation**

- **How It Works**:  
    Surfaces or volumes are described using procedural functions (e.g., noise functions).
    - Example: Fractal geometry or procedural terrains.
- **Usage**:
    - Procedural shading, texture generation, and modeling.
- **Pros**: Infinite detail and compact representation.
- **Cons**: Harder to perform exact computations like intersections.

### 8. **Point Cloud Representation**

- **How It Works**:  
    Objects are represented as a collection of points in 3D space.
- **Usage**:
    - Used in simulations, scanned data, and voxel-based ray tracing.
- **Pros**: Simple and memory-efficient.
- **Cons**: Requires conversion for rendering.
