**Thomas' Calculus** is an excellent resource for building foundational knowledge in calculus, and it does cover many concepts that are useful for understanding graphics. However, it may not focus enough on **geometry-specific applications** in computer graphics. For deep understanding and the ability to "grok" geometry in graphics, a combination of geometry, linear algebra, and calculus is essential. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **How Thomas' Calculus Helps**

- **Strengths**:
    - Covers core topics like derivatives, integrals, and vector calculus.
    - Provides an introduction to 3D space, gradients, and parameterized curves.
    - Builds intuition for surface integrals and partial derivatives, which are useful for shading, lighting, and ray intersections.
    - Great for understanding the mathematical rigor of shapes, curves, and rates of change.
- **Limitations**:
    - Does not focus specifically on geometric representations or their computational applications.
    - Lacks material on topics like transformations (matrices), implicit surfaces, or meshes, which are critical for graphics.
