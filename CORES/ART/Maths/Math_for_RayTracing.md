### Math Topics Required for "Introduction to Ray Tracing" by Andrew Glassner

1. **Linear Algebra**
    
    - Vectors: Addition, subtraction, dot product, cross product, and normalization.
    - Matrices: Transformation, rotation, scaling, and translation.
    - Homogeneous coordinates for 3D transformations.
2. **Analytic Geometry**
    
    - Equations of lines, planes, and spheres.
    - Intersections between rays and geometric shapes like spheres, planes, triangles, and polygons.
3. **Calculus (Basic)**
    
    - Understanding derivatives for surface normals and reflections.
    - Basics of integration, useful for understanding lighting models and global illumination.
4. **Trigonometry**
    
    - Angle calculations, sine, cosine, and their roles in lighting and shading models.
    - Reflections and refractions using Snell's law.
5. **Algebra**
    
    - Solving quadratic equations (for ray-sphere and ray-plane intersections).
    - Polynomial roots and discriminants.
6. **Physics (Optional but Useful)**
    
    - Basics of light behavior, including reflection, refraction, and dispersion.
