# two common ways of putting vertex data into a WebGPU buffer

They differ in **when/how the CPU writes to GPU memory**. Let‚Äôs break it down:

---

### üîπ Code 1 (using `mappedAtCreation`)

```js
const verticesBuffer = device.createBuffer({
  size: cubeVertexArray.byteLength,
  usage: GPUBufferUsage.VERTEX,
  mappedAtCreation: true,
});
new Float32Array(verticesBuffer.getMappedRange()).set(cubeVertexArray);
verticesBuffer.unmap();

```

üëâ This is **efficient for static/one-time uploads** (geometry that doesn‚Äôt change often), because you copy the data once at creation and never touch it again.

---

### üîπ Code 2 (using `queue.writeBuffer`)

```js
const vertexBuffer = device.createBuffer({
  label: "Cell vertices",
  size: vertices.byteLength,
  usage: GPUBufferUsage.VERTEX | GPUBufferUsage.COPY_DST,
});

device.queue.writeBuffer(vertexBuffer, 0, vertices);

const vertexBufferLayout = {
  arrayStride: 8,
  attributes: [{
    format: "float32x2",
    offset: 0,
    shaderLocation: 0, // Position. Matches @location(0) in the @vertex shader.
  }],
};

```

üëâ This is **better when you want to update the buffer often** (dynamic geometry, streaming data, changing per frame).

### ‚öñÔ∏è Key Differences

| Aspect               | Code 1 (mappedAtCreation)                         | Code 2 (queue.writeBuffer)              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| When data is written | At buffer creation (mapped)                       | After creation via `queue.writeBuffer`  |
| Usage flags          | Only needs `VERTEX`                               | Needs `VERTEX                           |
| Good for             | **Static data** (geometry that won‚Äôt change much) | **Dynamic data** (frequent updates)     |
| Efficiency           | Fast one-time setup, avoids extra copy            | Slightly more overhead but flexible     |
| Mapping              | Explicit `getMappedRange()` + `unmap()`           | No mapping, just direct `writeBuffer()` | 

---

üëâ Think of it like this:

- **Code 1 = "I know my vertices upfront, just bake them in when creating the buffer."**
- **Code 2 = "I want to upload/stream/change vertex data whenever I need."**

# two common ways of putting data into a WebGPU buffers

this is **not limited to vertex buffers** at all.  
The two upload strategies (`mappedAtCreation` vs. `queue.writeBuffer`) apply to **any kind of GPU buffer** in WebGPU:

---

### üîπ Uniform Buffers

Uniform buffers (`GPUBufferUsage.UNIFORM`) are just another kind of GPU buffer.  
You can fill them in the **same two ways**:

#### 1. **At creation (`mappedAtCreation`)**

```js
const uniformBuffer = device.createBuffer({
  size: 64, // must be aligned to 16 bytes!
  usage: GPUBufferUsage.UNIFORM,
  mappedAtCreation: true,
});

new Float32Array(uniformBuffer.getMappedRange()).set([
  1, 0, 0, 1, // e.g. color RGBA
  0, 0, 0, 0, // padding to 16-byte alignment
]);

uniformBuffer.unmap();

```

üëâ Best if the uniforms are **constant** (e.g. projection matrix that doesn‚Äôt change often).

---

#### 2. **Update later (`queue.writeBuffer`)**

```js
const uniformBuffer = device.createBuffer({
  size: 64,
  usage: GPUBufferUsage.UNIFORM | GPUBufferUsage.COPY_DST,
});

function updateUniforms(time) {
  const data = new Float32Array([
    Math.sin(time), 0, 0, 1,
    0, 0, 0, 0, // padding
  ]);
  device.queue.writeBuffer(uniformBuffer, 0, data.buffer);
}

```
üëâ Best if the uniforms are **dynamic per-frame** (e.g. camera matrices, animation parameters, per-frame time).

---

### üîπ General Rule

- **Static data** ‚Üí `mappedAtCreation` at buffer creation.
- **Dynamic / per-frame updates** ‚Üí `queue.writeBuffer` (or `writeBuffer` + `COPY_DST` usage flag).
    

This works for:

- Vertex buffers (`VERTEX`)
- Index buffers (`INDEX`)
- Uniform buffers (`UNIFORM`)
- Storage buffers (`STORAGE`)
    
- Any buffer you need to fill from the CPU.

‚ö†Ô∏è The only caveat: **alignment rules** apply more strictly to uniform buffers  
(e.g. each uniform block must be aligned to 16 bytes).
