# **Designed to Trust: The Human Journey to God**

_(Based on Chovot HaLevavot — Gate of Trust)_

God is perfect, complete, and beyond all need. He does not gain from our praise nor lose from our neglect. He does not require our trust, our work, or our prayers. **We are the ones who need Him** — because without Him the human heart cannot be whole.

Everything that comes from God is ultimately good. Even events that appear painful belong to a hidden mercy that the heart may recognize only later. Nothing harmful descends from Heaven; only what the soul requires for its mission.

## **Human Imperfection as a Divine Design**

God already created beings of perfect obedience — the angels — who never struggle and never grow. Humans, however, were created intentionally with:

- fear and courage,
- desire and discipline,
- clarity and confusion,
- strength and weakness.
    

Not because God wishes us to suffer, but because:

> Only through inner conflict can a person choose closeness to God.

Our imperfection is not an error; it is the **platform through which the heart rises**.

---

## **Free Will**

Although God already knows the outcome of every choice, He grants humans free will so that **the journey becomes ours**.  
We do not know the future — and this uncertainty is what makes **trust possible**.

Every decision becomes a spiritual opportunity:

- to remember our origin,
- to elevate our character,
- and to attach our heart to God.

## **Effort — A Vessel, Not a Cause**

A person must work, plan, and strive, not because these actions **bring success**, but because they are **the form through which God delivers what He has already decreed**.
Intelligence, talent, strategy, and effort are not **sources of livelihood** — they are **containers**.
The true source is God.

When a person believes their success comes from their own power, the result is anxiety and endless work. When a person understands that effort is only a vessel and God fills the vessel according to His wisdom, the heart becomes peaceful even while acting with responsibility.

## **Prayer**

Prayer is not for God — it is for us.  
It does not inform God of our needs; He knows them already.  
It redirects our heart from:

- fear to reliance,
- confusion to clarity,
- self-dependence to divine dependence.
    

Prayer protects the soul from worshipping work instead of God.

---

## **Repentance**

Because humans are not created perfect, failure is inevitable. Repentance is the divine gift that transforms failure into closeness.

Repentance:

- humbles the ego,
- purifies the conscience,
- restores direction,
- and brings the heart back to trust.
    

A person who falls and returns may rise even higher than one who never struggled.

## **Trust (Bitachon)**

Trust does not promise that life will be easy — it promises that **whatever God chooses will be good**.

The one who trusts:

- works without panic,
- hopes without illusions,
- accepts without bitterness,
- lives without envy,
- and depends on God rather than on circumstances.
    

Trust frees the heart even while living fully in the world.

## **Service to God**

Gate of Trust teaches that trust leads naturally to **service**, because inner peace frees a person to devote themselves to their true purpose.

Service to God means:

- living according to His will,
- using one’s blessings ethically,
- treating others with kindness and justice,
- remembering the Giver rather than worshipping the gifts,
- and allowing our actions to reflect gratitude rather than ego.
    

Service is not limited to religious activities.  
**A person who works, earns, raises a family, and contributes to society with the right intention is serving God.**

The purpose of service is not to benefit God — He lacks nothing.  
The purpose is to shape the human soul into its highest form.

## **The Divine Response**

When a person:

- chooses the good path,
- works ethically and moderately,
- attributes success to God rather than self,
- prays to remember the Source,
- repents when they fall,
- and serves God with sincere intention,
    

then **God grants assistance beyond human calculation** — not always in the form the person expected, but in the form that is ultimately best.

True guidance flows through **gentle, flexible, and uncertain paths**. When we act with **peaceful, sincere effort rooted in trust**, God provides countless blessings: **inner peace, guidance, clarity on next steps, perfect timing, focus, the right subjects to work on, steady effort, and even the natural flow of events**. These blessings **can come only from God**; no human action, no matter how clever, hardworking, or ambitious, can create them. God gives these gifts to those who move through uncertainty and difficulty with trust, letting His care and wisdom guide every step. When we work with this trust, our hearts remain calm even while we act, and our effort becomes a **vessel for His blessings**.

By contrast, **ego-driven effort** — focused on fixed results, certainty, or proving oneself to others — creates **stress, anxiety, procrastination, and inner conflict**. The ego demands control over outcomes, timing, and processes, which turns even rightful effort into struggle. Tasks feel heavy, decisions are delayed, and doubt grows, often leading to frustration or depression. Effort without trust becomes a burden; effort with trust becomes **support and guidance**.

**Trust transforms uncertainty into clear guidance, effort into blessing, and challenges into growth**. Ego transforms guidance into strain, uncertainty into fear, and work into paralysis. God wants us to **move forward into the unknown with faith**, relying on Him for the timing, direction, and support we cannot create ourselves. When we do, we experience the fullness of His blessings and earn true inner peace.

The book calls this:

> “The sweetness that comes to the heart that relies on Him.”

## **The Final State**

Through trust and service, a human being gains:

- peace without laziness,
- ambition without anxiety,
- work without slavery,
- success without arrogance,
- failure without despair,
- responsibility without fear,
- and love of God without running away from life.
    

The person remains active in the world, but the heart rests in Heaven.

This is the goal of the Gate of Trust:

> To live a full life in this world while carrying a heart that belongs to God.
