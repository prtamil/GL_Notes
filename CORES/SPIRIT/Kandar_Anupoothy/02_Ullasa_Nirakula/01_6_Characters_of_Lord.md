# **The Six Qualities and the Path of Losing the Self**

Arunagirinathar’s verse  
**“உல்லாச, நிராகுல, யோக இதச் / சல்லாப, விநோதனும் நீ அலையோ?”**  
is not just praise.  
It is a blueprint for a mental transformation that dissolves the ego layer by layer  
until nothing remains but _Muruga’s presence._

You recognized the core meaning correctly:  
**Muruga is the six-fold Guru, the one who shapes inner experience, corrects our mind, and reveals reality.**  
But the verse also hides a deeper movement:  
the _unmaking_ of the false self.

Your request—  
**“I want to lose everything, lose every attachment, and finally lose myself. Show me that path.”**  
—fits exactly into this six-step model.

Let’s unify everything.

---

## **1. Ullāsa — Joy That Burns Attachment**

Ullāsa is the rising joy that comes when the mind is not trapped in fear or desire.  
It is the “higher note” in your heart that keeps lifting you upward.

**Gita parallel:**  
Sattvic joy grows from clarity and dissolves craving.  
Desires fade not by suppression but by _tasting a higher sweetness._

**Gate of Trust:**  
When trust grows, the heart becomes light. Anxiety drops.  
This lightness is the first step in letting go.

**Path meaning:**  
Ullāsa is not a distraction.  
It is the power that makes attachments feel small.  
It pulls you out of your lower self.

---

## **2. Nirākula — Fearlessness and Anxiety-Free Mind**

Nirākula is the absence of inner agitation.  
Fear, guilt, panic, and confusion stop ruling your life.

**Gita parallel:**  
“Samatvam yoga ucyate” — balance is yoga.  
Calmness breaks the roots of attachment, because attachment = fear of loss.

**Gate of Trust:**  
Fear leaves when you know the Divine is taking care of every outcome.

**Path meaning:**  
You cannot lose yourself while clinging to fear.  
Nirākula creates the mental stability needed for surrender.

---

## **3. Yoga — The Centered, Disciplined Mind**

Yoga is the mind that is:

- steady
- self-mastered
- capable of right action
- free from outcome obsession
    

**Gita parallel:**  
“You have the right to action, not to results.”  
This is where the ego begins to break.

**Gate of Trust:**  
Responsibility + surrender = true stability.

**Path meaning:**  
Yoga is the point where you stop living as “I, me, mine”  
and start functioning as an instrument.  
This is the psychological dismantling of the self.

## **4. Ida — Harsh Truth Delivered with Compassion**

Muruga speaks the truth that breaks illusions,  
but He does it without crushing you.

**Gita parallel:**  
Krishna told Arjuna uncomfortable truths with a compassionate tone.  
Truth cuts the ego, but compassion keeps the heart open.

**Gate of Trust:**  
The Divine guides without humiliating.

**Path meaning:**  
You begin to recognize your false identities—  
your attachments, stories, fears, masks.  
They fall because the truth is gentle but unmistakably clear.

---

## **5. Sallāpa — Playful Correction Without Shame**

This is Muruga’s divine method:  
He corrects your errors without hurting you.  
He leads you away from wrong tendencies with affection.

**Gita parallel:**  
“Whenever the mind wanders, bring it back.”  
No anger, no shame—just steady correction.

**Gate of Trust:**  
Everything is arranged for your growth, even mistakes.

**Path meaning:**  
This removes guilt, self-hatred, and inner harshness.  
Your ego softens instead of resisting.  
You lose attachment not by force but by _being guided playfully by grace._

**Primary meaning**

- **Conversation**, **talk**, **chat**, **friendly speech**  
    (especially light, pleasant, affectionate, or intimate conversation)
    
**Nuances**

Depending on the context, _sallāpa_ can also mean:

- **Polite or gentle speech**
- **Mutual dialogue**
- **Friendly banter**
- **Lover’s talk** (in poetry)
- **Social interaction / companionship expressed through speech**

---

## **6. Vinoda — The Wonder of the Divine Play**

Finally, Vinoda is the realization that:

- life is orchestrated
- the impossible happens
- you are not the doer
- you were never in control
    

This is awe, marvel, and surrender.

**Gita parallel:**  
Krishna shows his universal form — Arjuna sees that everything is divine play.

**Gate of Trust:**  
All events are guided. Nothing is random.

**Path meaning:**  
Here, the ego dissolves completely.  
You lose yourself, not in destruction, but in surrender.  
You recognize:  
**“Everything is happening through Him. I am held, guided, carried.”**

This is the true loss of self.

# **The Full Path: How the Self Falls Away**

Together, the six qualities create a progression:

### **1. Ullāsa** Joy lifts you out of low desires.

### **2. Nirākula** Fear drops; the mind becomes safe to surrender.

### **3. Yoga** You act without ego and without obsession.

### **4. Ida** The truth breaks your illusions gently.

### **5. Sallāpa** Your mistakes correct themselves in the warmth of grace.

### **6. Vinoda** You finally surrender, amazed at the divine play.

**This is the path to losing attachments.  
This is the path to losing yourself.  
This is the path Muruga gives.**

Arunagirinathar ends the verse with a plea:  
**“எல்லாம் அற, என்னை இழந்த நலம் சொல்”—  
“Teach me the goodness of losing everything, including myself.”**

This is not self-destruction.  
It is the final shedding of the false identity so the true Self shines.

Muruga is not just the Lord of Lords.  
He is the one who:

- clears your mind,
- lifts your heart,
- centers your awareness,
- reveals the truth,
- corrects you without crushing you,
- and finally dissolves the “I” that was never real.


This is the path you asked for.

# **Conclusion — The Sixfold Guru and the Path of Losing the Self**

When Arunagirinathar looks at Muruga and says,  
**“உல்லாச, நிராகுல, யோக இதச் / சல்லாப, விநோதனும் நீ அலையோ?”**  
he is not merely praising six qualities.  
He is identifying **six faces of the ultimate Guru**,  
six inner forces that reshape a human being from the inside out.

Muruga is not a deity outside you;  
He is the intelligence that:

- lifts you (உல்லாச),
- calms you (நிராகுல),
- centers you (யோகம்),
- teaches you truth (இத),
- corrects you with tenderness (சல்லாப),
- and finally reveals His play everywhere (விநோத).
    

If these six qualities work within you,  
you don’t have to force detachment.  
You don’t have to fight ego.  
You don’t have to “destroy” anything.

**Muruga gradually _unmakes_ you.  
He dissolves the false layers.  
He leads you to the point where losing the self becomes effortless.**

The Gita says you don’t throw away the ego—  
you outgrow it through clarity, discipline, and surrender.  
Gate of Trust says fear, craving, and self-obsession fall away  
when you recognize you are held by a power wiser than you.

This sixfold path is the lived version of those teachings.

So when you say:

> **“Lord has 6 characteristics; He is the ultimate guru, reality.  
> What I want is to lose everything, lose all attachments,  
> and finally lose myself.  
> Give me that path, Lord Muruga, Lord of Lords.”**

the verse answers you:

**He _is_ that path.  
He _is_ the dismantling of the false self.  
He _is_ the guide who leads you to losing everything but Him.**

You don’t lose attachments by tearing them out;  
you lose them because:

- joy lifts you higher,
- calmness removes fear,
- yoga purifies action,
- truth breaks illusion,
- tender correction softens the ego,
- and divine wonder dissolves the sense of “I am the doer.”
    

When these six forces move through you,  
your identity fades like mist in sunlight.

And in the final stage,  
what remains is not “you,”  
but the **awareness**,  
the **clarity**,  
and the **stillness**  
that Muruga intended to awaken from the beginning.

This is what it means to “lose everything” in the spiritual sense—  
not destruction, but **liberation**.  
Not emptiness, but **fullness**.  
Not ego death, but **ego becoming transparent**.

**You don’t disappear.  
What disappears is everything that was never truly you.**

And in that silence,  
what remains is  
**Muruga’s presence as your own inner nature.**

That is the path.  
That is the loss.  
That is the freedom.
