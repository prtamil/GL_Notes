# Core Things to learn
```js

Bare metal (C/C++) makes the core firm and sound;  
REPL and Abstraction (Js/PY) shapes ideas leap and bound.  
Every shiny path will steal your years;  
Staying is how you master fears;  
Staying long brings blessings clear.
```

# Existence 

```js
my Existence is my permission from God.  
The gifts I was given are not trophies but tools are meant to gods purpose.  
Enhancing it and Apply to Service is my response — and my prayer.
```

# Choice Analysis

```js
What brings learning and joy, I allow to expand.  
What is driven by fear or prestige, I keep within bounds.  
Curiosity moves me forward; fear stays contained.
```

```js
Fear and prestige look for safety.  
Curiosity looks for truth.  
I follow what is real, and I limit what only seeks safety.
```
