Got it. Below is a **tighter, smaller, calmer one-page version**, centered **only on the 6-step learning tool**, with everything else compressed around it.

This is designed to be **glanced at**, not studied.

# My Bounded Learning Tool (One Page)

## Purpose

I learn best by understanding **fundamentals**, not memorizing.  
My only risk is **going too deep and not stopping**.  
This tool keeps learning **clear, useful, and time-safe**.

---

## The 2 Focus Questions (always first)

1. **What is the ONE thing I should focus on now?**
    
2. **What is the ONE fundamental here that makes everything else obvious?**
    

If I can’t answer these, I don’t start.

## The 6-Step Learning Tool

### 1. Stop rule (30 seconds)

**How will I know I understand enough to stop?**  
(e.g. explain in 3 lines, draw once, answer “why”)

---

### 2. Core idea

Write the **fundamental in one sentence**.

---

### 3. Reality check

**Where does this break in the real world?**  
(bugs, failures, security issues, perf cliffs)

---

### 4. Mental model

Build a simple model (diagram / flow / invariant).  
**When it clicks → stop immediately.**

---

### 5. Capture

Write in your own words:

- fundamental
    
- model
    
- break point
    
- proof of stop rule
    

**Max 1 page or 1 note.**

---

### 6. Light review

Revisit briefly:

- after 1–2 days
    
- weekly
    
- monthly if needed
    

---

## Optional (only if stuck)

**What is this like that I already understand well?**  
(Simple analogy.)

---

## Rules I follow

- One subject at a time
    
- One fundamental at a time
    
- No learning without a stop rule
    
- No polishing after it clicks
    

Depth is good.  
Endless depth is not.

## Final reminder

**If I am improving this tool instead of using it, I am avoiding the work.**  
The tool is finished.  
Use it calmly.
