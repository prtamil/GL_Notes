 C++/WinRT, a popular programming language for Windows development, is now in maintenance mode. This means that the language will no longer receive new feature work and will focus primarily on bug fixes and stability improvements. C++/WinRT has achieved its goals and is considered complete and largely bug-free. While some developers express concerns about the future of Windows development, the author suggests that embracing the Windows API as a whole, including Win32/COM/WinRT, is the best approach. Additionally, projects like win32metadata and windows-rs provide seamless support for both WinRT and non-WinRT APIs. Overall, developers using C++/WinRT can expect ongoing support and improvements, albeit with a focus on maintenance rather than new features.
