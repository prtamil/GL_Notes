 C++/WinRT, a popular programming language for Windows development, is now in maintenance mode. This means that the language will no longer receive new feature work and will focus primarily on bug fixes and stability improvements. C++/WinRT has achieved its goals and is considered complete and largely bug-free. While some developers express concerns about the future of Windows development, the author suggests that embracing the Windows API as a whole, including Win32/COM/WinRT, is the best approach. Additionally, projects like win32metadata and windows-rs provide seamless support for both WinRT and non-WinRT APIs. Overall, developers using C++/WinRT can expect ongoing support and improvements, albeit with a focus on maintenance rather than new features.

**that embracing the Windows API as a whole, including Win32/COM/WinRT, is the best approach**

So we can take 
1. Empty C++ Desktop project
2. Set Cpp to latest 20 and above
3. Use Nuget to get WTL
4. ATL/WinRT already present in windows sdk
5. And Start writing code. combine all WinRT/COM/Win32/Systems API.  its sufficient for app now
6. for Customer facing UI Microsoft suggest  WinUI3 (which has winRT)
7. Confusion about UWP (its deprecated. No AppContainer) WinRT/UWP is AppContainer WinRT/CPP is Native you can use without UWP. 
8. as of Oct2025 Microsoft also stops developing WinRT/C++17. its stable. but no new features. There is no alternative library no new library for new dev. time will tell.
9. Till then winrt/Win32/Com  with ATL/WTL  we can combine all and build native app.
