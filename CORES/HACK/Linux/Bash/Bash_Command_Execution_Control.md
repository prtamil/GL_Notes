The topics you mentioned (sequence execution, grouped execution, process substitution, etc.) fall under **Bash command execution and control** mechanisms. These are techniques used to manage command execution, redirection, and processing in Bash.

Below are different execution control techniques in Bash, including some you haven't mentioned.

---

## **1. Sequence Execution (`;`)**

- Executes commands **sequentially**, regardless of success or failure.
- Example:
    
  
    
    `echo "First command"; echo "Second command"`
    
    **Output:**
    
 
    
    `First command Second command`
    

---

## **2. Conditional Execution (`&&` and `||`)**

- `&&` â†’ Executes the second command **only if** the first one succeeds (exit code `0`).
- `||` â†’ Executes the second command **only if** the first one fails (exit code â‰  `0`).

### **Example:**



`mkdir mydir && cd mydir || echo "Failed to change directory"`

- If `mkdir mydir` succeeds, `cd mydir` executes.
- If `cd mydir` fails, `echo "Failed to change directory"` executes.

---

## **3. Grouped Execution (`{}` and `()`)**

### **Using `{}` (Same Shell Execution)**

- Groups multiple commands and executes them **in the same shell**.
- Must have spaces **before and after** `{}` and commands must be terminated with `;`.



`{ echo "Hello"; echo "World"; }`

**Output:**


`Hello World`

### **Using `()` (Subshell Execution)**

- Runs grouped commands **in a subshell**.
- Changes (e.g., `cd`, variables) inside **won't persist** after execution.


```bash
(cd /tmp; ls)
pwd  # This will NOT be affected by the 'cd' inside parentheses

```

---

## **4. Background Execution (`&`)**

- Runs a command **in the background** (doesn't wait for it to finish).
- Example:
    
 
    
    `sleep 5 & echo "Done"`
    
    - `sleep 5` runs in the background.
    - `echo "Done"` executes immediately.

---

## **5. Parallel Execution (`&` with `wait`)**

- Runs multiple commands **in parallel** and waits for them to finish.
- Example:
    
  ```bash
  (sleep 3; echo "Job 1 done") & (sleep 2; echo "Job 2 done") &
	wait  # Waits for both jobs to complete before proceeding
	echo "All jobs finished"

```
    
    **Output (order may vary):**
    
    `Job 2 done 
    `Job 1 done
    `All jobs finished`
    

---

## **6. Command Substitution (`$()` and "\` \`")**

- Captures the output of a command and **uses it as an argument**.
- Example:
    

    `echo "Today is: $(date)"`
    
    **Output:**
  
    
    `Today is: Mon Jan 31 12:00:00 UTC 2025`
    

---

## **7. Process Substitution (`<(command)`)**

- Treats command output as a **file-like stream**.
- Useful for commands that expect file input.

`diff <(ls /dir1) <(ls /dir2)`

- Compares directory listings without creating temp files.

---

## **8. Redirections (`>`, `>>`, `<`, `2>`, `&>`)**

- Redirects output, input, and error streams.

### **Standard Output Redirection (`>`, `>>`)**



`echo "Hello" > output.txt  # Overwrites file 
`echo "World" >> output.txt # Appends to file`

### **Standard Input Redirection (`<`)**



`wc -l < file.txt  # Counts lines in file.txt`

### **Standard Error Redirection (`2>` and `&>` )**



`command 2> error.log   # Redirects stderr to a file 
`command &> all.log     # Redirects both stdout and stderr`

---

## **9. Pipes (`|`)**

- Passes the output of one command as input to another.



`ls | grep "file"`

---

## **10. Here Documents (`<<`)**

- Sends multiple lines of input to a command.

`cat <<EOF This is a multi-line input. EOF`

---

## **11. Here Strings (`<<<`)**

- Passes a single string as input.

`wc -w <<< "Hello World"`

**Output:**


`2`

---

## **12. Brace Expansion (`{}`)**

- Generates sequences or lists of words.

`echo {1..5}`

**Output:**

`1 2 3 4 5`

---

## **13. Command Chaining with `xargs`**

- Passes output as arguments to another command.
```bash
echo "file1 file2 file3" | xargs rm

```

---

## **14. Command Execution with `eval`**

- Executes a string as a command.

```bash
cmd="ls -l"
eval $cmd

```

---

## **15. Job Control (`fg`, `bg`, `jobs`, `kill`)**

- Manages background jobs.


```bash
sleep 100 &   # Run in background
jobs          # List background jobs
fg %1         # Bring job 1 to foreground
bg %1         # Resume job 1 in background
kill %1       # Terminate job 1

```

## **Summary of Execution Techniques in Bash**

|**Technique**|**Purpose**|
|---|---|
|`command1; command2`|Sequential execution|
|`command1 && command2`|Run next only if first succeeds|
|`command1||
|`{ command1; command2; }`|Grouped execution in same shell|
|`( command1; command2 )`|Grouped execution in subshell|
|`command &`|Run command in background|
|`command1|command2`|
|`diff <(command1) <(command2)`|Process substitution|
|`command > file.txt`|Redirect output to file|
|`command 2> error.log`|Redirect error output|
|`wc -w <<< "text"`|Here string|
|`cat <<EOF ... EOF`|Here document|
|`echo {1..10}`|Brace expansion|
|`eval "ls -l"`|Execute a string as a command|
|`jobs`, `fg`, `bg`, `kill`|Job control|

### **Bash Command Execution and Control Mechanisms**

Bash provides various mechanisms to control how commands execute, including sequencing, conditional execution, parallel execution, redirections, and job control.

---

## **List of Bash Execution and Control Mechanisms**

### **1. Sequential Execution (`;`)**

- Runs commands one after another, regardless of success or failure.
    

    
    `command1; command2`
    

### **2. Conditional Execution (`&&` and `||`)**

- `&&` executes the second command **only if** the first succeeds.
- `||` executes the second command **only if** the first fails.
    
 
    
    `command1 && command2  # Runs command2 only if command1 succeeds 
    `command1 || command2  # Runs command2 only if command1 fails`
    

### **3. Grouped Execution (`{}` and `()`)**

- `{}` runs multiple commands in the **same shell**.
- `()` runs multiple commands in a **subshell**.
    

    
    `{ command1; command2; }  # Same shell 
    `( command1; command2 )  # Subshell`
    

### **4. Background Execution (`&`)**

- Runs a command in the background without waiting for completion.
    
 
    `command &`
    

### **5. Parallel Execution (`&` with `wait`)**

- Runs multiple commands in parallel and waits for them to finish.
    
 
    
    `(command1 &) (command2 &) wait`
    

### **6. Command Substitution (`$()` and )**

    `echo "Today is: $(date)"`
    

### **7. Process Substitution (`<()` and `>()`)**

- Treats command output as a temporary file.
    
 
    
    `diff <(command1) <(command2)`
    

### **8. Pipes (`|`)**

- Sends the output of one command as input to another.

    
    `ls | grep "pattern"`
    

### **9. Input and Output Redirection (`>`, `>>`, `<`, `2>`, `&>`)**

- Redirects command input, output, and errors.
    

    
    `command > output.txt  # Redirect stdout command 2> error.log  # Redirect stderr command &> all.log    # Redirect stdout and stderr`
    

### **10. Here Documents (`<<`)**

- Passes multiple lines of input to a command.
    

    
    `cat <<EOF Line 1 Line 2 EOF`
    

### **11. Here Strings (`<<<`)**

- Passes a single string as input.
    
  
    
    `wc -w <<< "Hello World"`
    

### **12. Brace Expansion (`{}`)**

- Expands a sequence of values or file names.
    

    `echo {1..5}`
    

### **13. Command Chaining with `xargs`**

- Passes command output as arguments to another command.
    

    
    `echo "file1 file2" | xargs rm`
    

### **14. Command Execution with `eval`**

- Evaluates and executes a string as a command.
    

    
    `cmd="ls -l"
    `eval $cmd`
    

### **15. Job Control (`jobs`, `fg`, `bg`, `kill`)**

- Manages background and foreground jobs.
```bash
sleep 100 &   # Run in background
jobs          # List jobs
fg %1         # Bring job 1 to foreground
bg %1         # Resume job 1 in background
kill %1       # Kill job 1

```
