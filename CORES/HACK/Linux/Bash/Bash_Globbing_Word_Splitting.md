Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting. what is this can you exaplain this issue in shell script case by case and explain in detail

###### ChatGPT said:

In shell scripting (e.g., Bash), **double quotes** are used to prevent **globbing** and **word splitting**, which can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled correctly. Let's go through these concepts in detail, with case-by-case examples to understand why double-quoting is essential.

---

# 1. **What is Globbing?**

**Globbing** is the process by which the shell expands **wildcard characters** (`*`, `?`, and `[]`) into matching filenames in the current directory.

### Example Without Double Quotes:



`echo *.txt`

If the directory has files `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, and `notes.txt`, the output will be:



`file1.txt file2.txt notes.txt`

### Example With Double Quotes:



`echo "*.txt"`

Output:

CopyEdit

`*.txt`

By using double quotes, globbing is prevented, and the wildcard is treated as a literal string.

---

## 2. **What is Word Splitting?**

**Word splitting** occurs when the shell breaks a string into multiple words (arguments) based on **whitespace** (spaces, tabs, newlines).

### Example Without Double Quotes:


`filename="my file with spaces.txt" cp $filename /destination/`

The shell splits it as:



`cp my file with spaces.txt /destination/`

This results in an error because `cp` sees **four arguments** instead of **two**.

### Example With Double Quotes:



`cp "$filename" /destination/`

The command becomes:


`cp "my file with spaces.txt" /destination/`

This preserves the filename as a single argument, avoiding the word-splitting issue.

---

## 3. **Case by Case Analysis**

### **Case 1: Handling Variables with Spaces**



`name="John Doe" echo Hello, $name!`

Output:


`Hello, John Doe!`

This seems fine, but if used in a command:


`mkdir /home/$name`

It tries to create two directories:


`/home/John and /home/Doe`

**Correct Usage with Double Quotes:**



`mkdir "/home/$name"`

This safely creates one directory:


`/home/John Doe`

---

### **Case 2: Looping Over Filenames with Spaces**

Without double quotes:


`for file in *.txt; do   echo Processing $file done`

If a file is named `my notes.txt`, the output will be:



`Processing my Processing notes.txt`

**Correct Usage with Double Quotes:**


`for file in *.txt; do   echo "Processing $file" done`

Output:


`Processing my notes.txt`

---

### **Case 3: Globbing Pitfall in Arguments**

Without double quotes:



`rm *.log`

If no `.log` files exist, it expands to:

`rm *.log`



`rm: cannot remove '*.log': No such file or directory`

**Safer Usage:**



`rm -- *.log`

The `--` prevents issues if the glob expands to a value starting with `-` (e.g., `-f.log`).

Or, using double quotes when passing as an argument:



`pattern="*.log" rm $pattern    # Risky, expands if files exist rm "$pattern"  # Safe, treated as a literal string`

---

### **Case 4: Command Substitution with Spaces**

Without double quotes:



`files=$(ls *.txt) echo $files`

If filenames have spaces, they get split into words:



`file1.txt file2.txt my notes.txt`

This becomes:


`echo file1.txt file2.txt my notes.txt`

Which prints each part separately.

**Correct Usage with Double Quotes:**



`files=$(ls *.txt) echo "$files"`

This preserves the whitespace within filenames:



`file1.txt file2.txt my notes.txt`

---

### **Case 5: Special Characters and Globbing**

Consider:



`pattern="*.sh" echo $pattern`

If there are shell scripts in the directory, it expands to their names:



`script1.sh script2.sh`

**To avoid unintended globbing:**


`echo "$pattern"`

Output:


`*.sh`

The wildcard is preserved as-is.

---

## **Summary of Best Practices:**

1. **Always quote variables** unless you **explicitly want word splitting or globbing**. Example:
    
    
    `echo "$var"`
    
2. **Quote command substitutions**:
    

    
    `output="$(command)" echo "$output"`
    
3. **Quote loop variables**:
    
   
    
    `for file in *.txt; do   echo "$file" done`
    
4. **When using wildcards as literals**, always use double quotes:
    

    
    `pattern="*.txt" echo "$pattern"`
    

---

## **Summary of Effects:**

- **Double Quotes**: Preserve literal strings, including spaces and special characters.
- **No Quotes**: Allow globbing and word splitting, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
