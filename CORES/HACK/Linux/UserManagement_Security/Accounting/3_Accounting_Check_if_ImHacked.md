say these are the only methods i can find who hacked my machine

If you suspect that your machine has been hacked and you **only have access to syslog, journald, auditd, and acct/pacct**, here‚Äôs how you can investigate using these tools.

## **üîç Step-by-Step Investigation Plan**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Look for Unauthorized Logins (syslog & journald)**

#### **Check authentication logs (login attempts)**

bash

CopyEdit

`cat /var/log/auth.log | grep "Failed password" 
`journalctl -u sshd --since "1 day ago"`

‚úÖ **Look for:**

- Many failed SSH login attempts (brute force).
- Successful logins from unusual IPs.
- New users being created (`useradd` in logs).

#### **Check system reboots (sign of tampering)**


`journalctl --grep "reboot" --since "1 day ago" last reboot`

‚úÖ **Look for:**

- Unexpected reboots that you didn‚Äôt initiate.
- A reboot followed by new login sessions.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Look for Suspicious Commands (acct/pacct)**

#### **List recently executed commands by all users**


`lastcomm`

#### **See what root executed**


`lastcomm -u root`

‚úÖ **Look for:**

- Commands like `nc` (netcat), `wget`, `curl` (downloading malware).
- `chmod 777`, `chown root` (privilege escalation).
- `kill syslog` (hiding activities).

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Look for File Modifications (auditd)**

#### **Check if critical system files were modified**


`ausearch -f /etc/passwd 
`ausearch -f /etc/shadow 
`ausearch -f /root/.ssh/authorized_keys`

‚úÖ **Look for:**

- Unauthorized edits in `/etc/passwd` (new suspicious users).
- Modifications to `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` (backdoor SSH access).

#### **See what a suspicious user did**

`ausearch -ua <user_ID>`

‚úÖ **Look for:**

- What commands they ran (`execve` system calls).

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Look for Open Connections (syslog & journald)**

#### **Check who‚Äôs SSHing in**


`journalctl -u sshd --no-pager | grep "Accepted" cat /var/log/auth.log | grep "Accepted"`

‚úÖ **Look for:**

- Unrecognized IPs gaining access.

#### **Check running network connections**


`netstat -tulnp ss -tulnp`

‚úÖ **Look for:**

- Unexpected listening services (backdoors like netcat).

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Check for Log Tampering**

If an attacker tried to **cover their tracks**, logs may be missing or wiped:



`ls -lah /var/log/auth.log 
`ls -lah /var/log/audit/audit.log
`journalctl --verify`

‚úÖ **Look for:**

- **Log files suddenly empty** (`0 bytes`).
- `journalctl --verify` showing corruption (someone altered logs).

## **üö® What to Do If You Find Something Suspicious?**

1. **Immediately disconnect the machine from the network** to prevent further compromise.
2. **Check `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`** for unauthorized user accounts.
3. **Backup evidence** (`cp /var/log/auth.log /safe_location/`).
4. **Kill any suspicious processes** (`kill -9 <PID>` from `netstat -tulnp`).
5. **Consider reinstalling the system** if root access was breached.

**Logs never lie**‚Äîeven if an attacker wipes some, traces remain. **Did you find anything odd?** üö®
