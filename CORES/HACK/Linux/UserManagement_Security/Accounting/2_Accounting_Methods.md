## **Deep Dive into Linux Logging & Accounting Systems**

Below is a structured breakdown of
1. **syslog
2. **journald
3. **auditd
4. **acct/pacct**
covering **how they work, their use cases, and essential commands**.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ syslog (Traditional Logging System)**

### **üõ† How It Works**

- `syslog` is the **classic logging system** in Linux.
- Logs messages from **the kernel, system services, and applications**.
- Uses a **central configuration file** (`/etc/rsyslog.conf`).
- Log files are typically stored in `/var/log/` (e.g., `/var/log/syslog`, `/var/log/auth.log`).
- Supports **remote logging** to send logs to a central server.

### **üìå Use Cases**

‚úÖ Storing **general system logs** (errors, warnings, application logs).  
‚úÖ Monitoring **login attempts** (`auth.log`).  
‚úÖ Tracking **cron jobs** (`cron.log`).  
‚úÖ Sending logs to **remote logging servers**.

### **üìñ Commands Overview**

- View system logs:
    
    `cat /var/log/syslog`
    
- View authentication logs (failed/successful logins):
    
    `cat /var/log/auth.log`
    
- Send a custom log message:

    `logger "This is a test log message"`
    
- Restart `rsyslog`:

    `systemctl restart rsyslog`
    
- Configure remote logging:
    - Edit `/etc/rsyslog.conf` and add:

        `*.* @logserver.example.com:514`
        
    - Restart the service.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ journald (Modern Structured Logging)**

### **üõ† How It Works**

- Introduced with **systemd**, `journald` is a **binary-based, structured logging system**.
- Stores logs in **binary format** (`/var/log/journal/`).
- Can capture **metadata** (PID, UID, system state, etc.).
- **Faster search & filtering** than syslog.

### **üìå Use Cases**

‚úÖ **Live log monitoring** (`journalctl -f`).  
‚úÖ **Query logs with filtering** (by service, boot session, etc.).  
‚úÖ **Structured logs** (JSON output).  
‚úÖ Useful for **troubleshooting failed services** (`systemctl status`).

### **üìñ Commands Overview**

- View all logs:
    
    
    `journalctl`
    
- View logs in real-time:

    `journalctl -f`
    
- View logs for a specific service:

    `journalctl -u sshd`
    
- View logs from the last boot:
    
    `journalctl -b`
    
- Filter logs by time:
    
    `journalctl --since "1 hour ago"`
    
- Show logs in JSON format:
    
    `journalctl -o json-pretty`
    
- Clear logs:
        
    `journalctl --vacuum-time=1d  # Delete logs older than 1 day`

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ auditd (Security Auditing)**

### **üõ† How It Works**

- `auditd` is the **Linux Auditing System**, used for **security monitoring**.
- Tracks **system calls, user actions, and access control violations**.
- Logs are stored in `/var/log/audit/audit.log`.
- Uses rules to **monitor file access, command execution, or system changes**.

### **üìå Use Cases**

‚úÖ Tracking **who accessed which files**.  
‚úÖ Monitoring **user actions (logins, sudo usage, failed access attempts)**.  
‚úÖ Auditing **security-related events** (modifying `/etc/shadow`, system calls).  
‚úÖ Detecting **privilege escalation attempts**.

### **üìñ Commands Overview**

- View audit logs:
    
    `cat /var/log/audit/audit.log`
    
- Check login attempts:
    
    `ausearch -m LOGIN`
    
- Monitor file access (track who accesses `/etc/passwd`):
    `auditctl -w /etc/passwd -p wa -k passwd_changes`
    
- List active audit rules:
    `auditctl -l`
    
- Generate audit reports:
    
    `aureport -au  # Authentication report aureport -f   # File access report`
    
- Track commands executed by a user (`root` in this case):
    
    `ausearch -ua 0`
    
- Remove an audit rule:
    `auditctl -W /etc/passwd -p wa -k passwd_changes`

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ acct/pacct (Process Accounting)**

### **üõ† How It Works**

- `acct` (or `pacct`) is a **process accounting system**.
- Logs every **command executed**, along with the **user, time, and duration**.
- Uses the file `/var/log/account/pacct` to store logs.

### **üìå Use Cases**

‚úÖ **Monitor user activity** (track every command executed).  
‚úÖ **Forensics & auditing** (who ran what and when).  
‚úÖ **Track resource usage** (execution time of processes).

### **üìñ Commands Overview**

- Install process accounting tools:
    
    `sudo apt install acct  # (Debian-based) 
    `sudo yum install psacct  # (RHEL-based)`
    
- Enable process accounting:
    
    `accton on`
    
- Check if accounting is active:
    
    
    `accton`
    
- View commands executed by users:
    
    
    `lastcomm`
    
- Show summary of resource usage per user:
    
    `sa`
    
- Show execution details of a specific command:
    
    
    `lastcomm ls`
    
- Disable accounting:

    
    `accton off`

## **üöÄ Quick Recap & Learning Triggers**

|Question|Quick Trigger|
|---|---|
|Where are system logs stored?|`/var/log/` (syslog)|
|How do I check live logs?|`journalctl -f`|
|What tool tracks user activity?|`acct` (`lastcomm`, `sa`)|

## **üîë Final Takeaways**

- Use **syslog/journald** for general system logs.
- Use **auditd** for **security** monitoring.
- Use **acct/pacct** for **tracking executed commands**.
- Combine **log rotation, remote logging, and audit rules** for a **robust logging strategy**.
