# PAM Intro
One doubt on linux we have user managment (useradd, groups) etc. but we have passwd, ACL, SSH and AppArmour SELinux etc.. you can add if i left something. can you categoruze this on based on authentication and autorization im confused all have permsiions which will work on which scenario

Good question! Authentication and authorization both involve permissions but serve different purposes. Letâ€™s break them down:

---

### **Authentication (Who you are)**

Authentication verifies a userâ€™s identity. The following are authentication-related mechanisms:

1. **User Management (useradd, passwd, groups, shadow, etc.)**
    
    - `useradd`, `usermod`, `groupadd`: Manage user and group accounts.
    - `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`: Store user account details and hashed passwords.
    - `passwd`: Change user passwords.
2. **SSH (Secure Shell)**
    
    - Used for remote authentication via passwords or keys (`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`).
    - Authentication methods:
        - Password-based authentication.
        - Key-based authentication (public-private keys).
        - PAM-based authentication.
3. **Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM)**
    
    - Provides modular authentication.
    - Used in login, SSH, sudo, and other authentication scenarios.
    - Located at `/etc/pam.d/`.

---

### **Authorization (What you can do)**

Authorization controls access and permissions after authentication. These mechanisms handle authorization:

1. **File and Directory Permissions**
    
    - `chmod`, `chown`, `chgrp`: Set ownership and permissions (`rwx`).
    - `/etc/group`: Manages user groups.
2. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**
    
    - `getfacl`, `setfacl`: Provide fine-grained permissions beyond standard Unix permissions.
3. **sudo (Privilege Escalation)**
    
    - `/etc/sudoers` controls which users can run commands as root.
    - Uses PAM for additional policies.
4. **SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)**
    
    - Mandatory Access Control (MAC).
    - Uses security policies (`Enforcing`, `Permissive`, `Disabled`).
    - Works based on security contexts (`ls -Z`).
5. **AppArmor**
    
    - Similar to SELinux but profile-based.
    - Uses predefined security policies to confine applications.
6. **Capabilities (`capsh`, `setcap`, `getcap`)**
    
    - Divide root privileges into smaller units (`CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`, `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`).
    - Applied to binaries.

---

### **Hybrid (Authentication + Authorization)**

Some mechanisms handle both authentication and authorization:

1. **PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)**
    
    - Handles authentication (`pam_unix.so`, `pam_ldap.so`).
    - Can also enforce authorization policies (`pam_limits.so`, `pam_time.so`).
2. **SSH**
    
    - Authenticates users via keys or passwords.
    - Can enforce authorization (`AllowUsers`, `DenyUsers` in `sshd_config`).

---

### **Scenarios**

|Scenario|Mechanism|
|---|---|
|User login|Authentication (`passwd`, `PAM`)|
|Remote login|Authentication (`SSH`)|
|Restricting file access|Authorization (`chmod`, `ACLs`)|
|Giving limited root access|Authorization (`sudo`, `capabilities`)|
|Restricting network access for a process|Authorization (`SELinux`, `AppArmor`)|
|Fine-grained user policies|Hybrid (`PAM`, `SSH configs`)|

# How does PAM Fit in Auth and Authz

in Authentication (Who you are) how does pam fit in. if i installed linux them will pam be active if i login with ssh will pam be active i think of pam is active is controlling the system it will redirect to subsystems such as ssh, kerbros etc.. am i right or wrong

###### ChatGPT said:

You're thinking in the right direction! PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module) is **always active** in modern Linux systems, and it acts as a flexible authentication framework that integrates with various authentication mechanisms like SSH, local login, Kerberos, and more. Letâ€™s break it down:

---

### **1. Is PAM active by default?**

Yes!

- When you install Linux, PAM is **enabled by default** in most distributions (Ubuntu, RHEL, Debian, etc.).
- It manages authentication for various services like `login`, `ssh`, `sudo`, `passwd`, and more.
- Configuration files are found in `/etc/pam.d/`.

---

### **2. How does PAM fit into Authentication?**

PAM is like a **middleware** that connects authentication requests (from services like SSH, `login`, `sudo`) to actual authentication mechanisms (like `/etc/passwd`, Kerberos, LDAP, etc.).

ðŸ’¡ **Think of PAM as a gatekeeper that checks "Who you are" before allowing access.**  
It determines **how** authentication happens but doesn't store passwords itself.

---

### **3. When you log in (SSH, local, etc.), does PAM control it?**

Yes!

- **If you log in via SSH** (`sshd`), PAM is used for authentication.
- **If you log in locally** (`login` command), PAM is used.
- **If you use `sudo`**, PAM is used.
- **If you change passwords (`passwd`)**, PAM is used.
- **If you use GUI login (GDM, SDDM, LightDM)**, PAM is used.

So, PAM is **always in action** for authentication unless explicitly disabled.

---

### **4. How does PAM "redirect" authentication?**

PAM works as a **framework**, and different authentication methods (passwords, Kerberos, LDAP, etc.) are configured as modules inside `/etc/pam.d/`.

When a service (like SSH) requests authentication, PAM does the following:

1. **Checks its rules** for that service in `/etc/pam.d/`.
2. **Calls the required authentication module** (e.g., `pam_unix.so` for local passwords, `pam_krb5.so` for Kerberos).
3. **The module performs the authentication** (password check, fingerprint scan, etc.).
4. **Returns success or failure** to PAM.
5. **PAM tells the service (SSH, sudo, etc.)** whether authentication was successful.

ðŸ’¡ **Example: When you log in via SSH**

1. SSH daemon (`sshd`) asks PAM to authenticate the user.
2. PAM checks `/etc/pam.d/sshd` for rules.
3. It may use `pam_unix.so` (local passwords) or `pam_krb5.so` (Kerberos) based on configuration.
4. The authentication module verifies your credentials.
5. If successful, PAM grants access to SSH.

---

### **5. PAM and Subsystems (Kerberos, LDAP, etc.)**

- **PAM itself does NOT authenticate**â€”it just forwards authentication to the correct module.
- Modules like `pam_krb5.so`, `pam_ldap.so`, and `pam_unix.so` handle actual authentication.
- PAM allows the system admin to **choose which authentication method to use** for each service.

---

### **6. Example PAM Configuration (`/etc/pam.d/sshd`)**

This file controls SSH authentication.

```bash
# Standard Unix authentication (passwords)
auth required pam_unix.so

# Allow Kerberos authentication
auth optional pam_krb5.so

# Deny access to users in /etc/nologin
account required pam_nologin.so

```

- Here, SSH will first check local passwords (`pam_unix.so`).
- If Kerberos is configured, it will also check `pam_krb5.so`.
- If `/etc/nologin` exists, PAM will block access.

---

### **7. What happens if PAM is disabled?**

- If you remove PAM (`pam_unix.so`, etc.), **authentication will break**.
- Services like SSH, `sudo`, and `login` will stop working unless they have an alternative authentication method.

---

### **Conclusion**

âœ… PAM **is always active** and controls authentication.  
âœ… It **redirects authentication requests** to subsystems like passwords, Kerberos, and LDAP.  
âœ… It **does not store credentials** but enforces authentication policies.  
âœ… It **works with every authentication service** (SSH, login, sudo, passwd, etc.).

You got the right idea! PAM is a central controller for authentication, and it decides where to send the authentication request (password, Kerberos, etc.).

# PAM and Configuration Customization
##### You said:

say for sudo i need unix authentication for ssh i need ldap how does pam config looks like and can you explain line by line

###### ChatGPT said:

Great question! Letâ€™s configure PAM to use **Unix authentication (`/etc/shadow`) for `sudo`** and **LDAP authentication for `ssh`**.

---

## **1. Understanding PAM Configuration**

PAM configuration files are in `/etc/pam.d/`.  
Each service (like `sudo`, `ssh`) has its own file, which tells PAM how to authenticate users.

- **`/etc/pam.d/sudo`** â†’ Controls authentication for `sudo`
- **`/etc/pam.d/sshd`** â†’ Controls authentication for SSH (`sshd` service)

### **Modules used:**

- `pam_unix.so` â†’ Unix authentication (uses `/etc/shadow` for passwords).
- `pam_ldap.so` â†’ LDAP authentication (uses an external LDAP server).

---

## **2. Configuring `sudo` to use Unix authentication**

Edit `/etc/pam.d/sudo` to ensure only Unix authentication is used:

```bash
#%PAM-1.0
auth    required    pam_unix.so
account required    pam_unix.so
session required    pam_unix.so

```

### **Explanation (Line by Line)**

|Line|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`auth required pam_unix.so`|User must authenticate using Unix password (`/etc/shadow`).|
|`account required pam_unix.so`|Checks if the account is valid (not expired or locked).|
|`session required pam_unix.so`|Ensures session is properly opened and logged.|

âœ… **Result**:  
When a user runs `sudo`, PAM will check their password in `/etc/shadow`.

---

## **3. Configuring SSH to use LDAP authentication**

Edit `/etc/pam.d/sshd` to make SSH use LDAP authentication:

```bash
#%PAM-1.0
auth    required    pam_ldap.so
account required    pam_ldap.so
session required    pam_ldap.so

```

### **Explanation (Line by Line)**

|Line|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`auth required pam_ldap.so`|Authenticate user via LDAP (external directory server).|
|`account required pam_ldap.so`|Check if the LDAP account is valid.|
|`session required pam_ldap.so`|Manage user session (e.g., log activity).|

âœ… **Result**:  
When a user logs in via SSH, PAM will authenticate them using LDAP instead of local Unix passwords.

---

## **4. What happens now?**

- `sudo` will **only** check `/etc/shadow` (local passwords).
- `ssh` will **only** check LDAP for authentication.
- Other services (like `login`) will behave according to their respective PAM configurations.

ðŸ’¡ **Bonus:**

- If you want **both** Unix and LDAP authentication for SSH, you can do:
    ```bash
    auth required pam_unix.so
	auth required pam_ldap.so
	```
    
    This forces both checks.
    
- If you want **either** Unix **or** LDAP authentication for SSH, you can do:
    
```bash
auth sufficient pam_ldap.so
auth required pam_unix.so

```
    
    This means:
    
    - If LDAP authentication succeeds, no need to check Unix (`sufficient`).
    - If LDAP fails, fallback to Unix (`required`).

---

## **5. Testing the Configuration**

### âœ… **Test `sudo` with Unix authentication**

`sudo -l`

- It should ask for your **Unix password** (from `/etc/shadow`).

### âœ… **Test `ssh` with LDAP authentication**



`ssh user@your-server`

- It should authenticate using **LDAP credentials**.

---

## **6. Debugging Issues**

If something is not working:

- Check `/var/log/auth.log` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `/var/log/secure` (RHEL).
- Run PAM tests:
    

    `pamtester sudo youruser authenticate`
    
    
    `pamtester sshd youruser authenticate`
    
- Verify LDAP connection:
    
    
    `ldapsearch -x -LLL -H ldap://your-ldap-server -b "dc=example,dc=com"`
    

---

## **Final Thoughts**

âœ… PAM allows fine-grained control over authentication for each service.  
âœ… You can **customize authentication** per service (`sudo` â†’ Unix, `ssh` â†’ LDAP).  
âœ… PAM modules (`pam_unix.so`, `pam_ldap.so`) handle different authentication mechanisms.
