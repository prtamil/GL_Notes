### AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting)

AAA is a security framework used to control access to systems, enforce policies, and track user activities. It consists of three core components:

1. **Authentication** – Verifying who the user is.
2. **Authorization** – Determining what the user can do.
3. **Accounting** – Tracking user actions and resource usage.

### IAA (Identification, Authentication, and Authorization)

IAA is a closely related concept that slightly shifts the focus:

1. **Identification** – Recognizing a user (e.g., username or user ID).
2. **Authentication** – Verifying the identity (e.g., password, SSH key).
3. **Authorization** – Granting access to specific resources.

### How AAA/IAA Fits into Linux Administration

As a Linux admin, understanding AAA/IAA is crucial for securing systems, managing users, and enforcing policies. Here's how it applies:

#### **1. Authentication in Linux**

- **User authentication:** Done via `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, or authentication services like LDAP, Kerberos, and PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules).
- **SSH authentication:** Uses passwords, public/private key authentication, or multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- **PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module):** Controls authentication methods (e.g., `/etc/pam.d/sshd` for SSH authentication).

#### **2. Authorization in Linux**

- **File Permissions & Ownership:** Controlled using `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp`.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** `setfacl` and `getfacl` provide fine-grained control.
- **sudo and Polkit:** `sudo` allows privilege escalation, while `polkit` manages system-wide authorization policies.
- **SELinux/AppArmor:** Mandatory Access Control (MAC) frameworks that enforce strict security policies.

#### **3. Accounting in Linux**

- **Logging:** System logs in `/var/log/auth.log` (Debian-based) or `/var/log/secure` (RHEL-based).
- **Audit Framework (`auditd`):** Tracks security-relevant events, configured via `/etc/audit/audit.rules`.
- **User Activity Monitoring:**
    - `last` (login history)
    - `who` (logged-in users)
    - `w` (active users and their activity)
    - `ps` and `top` (monitor running processes)

### **Real-World Example**

If you're managing SSH access:

1. **Authentication:** Configure SSH key-based authentication (`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`).
2. **Authorization:** Restrict users in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` (`AllowUsers`, `DenyUsers`).
3. **Accounting:** Enable logging with `journalctl -u sshd` and monitor logins with `last -f /var/log/wtmp`.
