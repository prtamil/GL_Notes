### **History of Authentication & Authorization in Linux**

Authentication (Auth) and Authorization (AuthZ) in Linux have evolved significantly over the decades to improve security, flexibility, and scalability. Below is a historical timeline, including what you might have missed.

---

## **1. Early Unix Authentication & Authorization (1970s–1980s)**

- **Users & Passwords (`/etc/passwd`)**
    
    - Introduced in early **Unix (1970s, AT&T Bell Labs)**.
    - Stored **all user details** in `/etc/passwd`, including encrypted passwords.
    - **Security issue:** The file had to be world-readable for user lookups, making password hashes accessible.
- **Groups (`/etc/group`)**
    
    - Introduced in **4.2BSD (1983)**.
    - Allowed multiple users to share permissions.
    - **Limitations:** Could only specify one primary group per user; secondary groups later added.

---

## **2. Improving Security with `/etc/shadow` (1980s–1990s)**

- **Shadow Passwords (`/etc/shadow`)**
    
    - Introduced in **System V Release 4 (SVR4, late 1980s)** and adopted in **Linux (1988)**.
    - **Passwords moved to `/etc/shadow`**, which is only readable by root.
    - Added **password aging, expiration, and account lockout features**.
- **Example of /etc/shadow entry:**
    
    `user1:$6$hUQxP91G$y8g3U...:19108:0:99999:7:::`
    
    - `$6$` → SHA-512 hashing.
    - Fields store last password change date, expiry, and lockout settings.

---

## **3. Role-Based Access Control: ACLs & File Permissions (1990s–2000s)**

- **Traditional File Permissions (1970s–Present)**
    
    - Used `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp` to control access.
    - **Limitations:** Could only assign permissions to an owner, a group, and others.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs) (2000s)**
    
    - **POSIX ACLs introduced in Linux 2.6 (2003)**.
    - Allowed more **fine-grained permissions** than traditional Unix file permissions.
    - Example:
        
        `setfacl -m u:user2:r file.txt getfacl file.txt`
        
    - **Enterprise adoption**: Used in **network file systems (NFS, Samba)**.

---

## **4. Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) (1997–Present)**

- **Before PAM:** Authentication methods were hardcoded into applications.
    
- **PAM introduced in Linux in 1997**, inspired by **Solaris**.
    
- **Modular authentication system**, allowing different authentication mechanisms without modifying applications.
    
- Used for **login, SSH, sudo, system-wide security policies**.
    
- **Example PAM configuration (/etc/pam.d/sshd)**
  
	```bash
	auth required pam_unix.so
	auth required pam_tally2.so deny=5 unlock_time=900

	```
    
    - Enforces **password authentication**.
    - **Locks the user account after 5 failed attempts**.

---

## **5. Mandatory Access Control (MAC) for Advanced Security (2000s–Present)**

- **Traditional access control (Discretionary Access Control, DAC)** is based on user ownership.
- **MAC (Mandatory Access Control) adds security policies that cannot be overridden by users.**

### **SELinux (2000, by NSA)**

- Added to **Linux kernel 2.6 (2003)**.
- Uses **security labels & policies** to enforce access control.
- Example: Check SELinux context of a file:
    
    `ls -Z /var/www/html/index.html`
    
    - Output: `system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0`
- **Enterprise use:** RHEL, Fedora, CentOS.

### **AppArmor (2005, by Immunix, later Ubuntu)**

- **Simpler alternative to SELinux**, using profiles instead of labeling.
- **Default in Ubuntu (since 2007)**.
- Example profile:

```bash
/usr/bin/program {
  deny /etc/ w,
}

```

## **6. Centralized Authentication & Enterprise Security (2010s–Present)**

- **Kerberos (Single Sign-On)**
    
    - Network authentication protocol using tickets.
    - Used by **Active Directory, FreeIPA**.
    - Example: `kinit user@DOMAIN.COM`
- **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)**
    
    - Used for centralized authentication in enterprises.
    - Example: `/etc/nsswitch.conf`
   ```bash
	   passwd: files ldap
	   shadow: files ldap
	   group: files ldap

	```
        
- **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**
    
    - Google Authenticator, Yubikey, Duo.
    - PAM integration: `/etc/pam.d/sshd`
        
        `auth required pam_google_authenticator.so`
        
- **OAuth & OpenID Connect**
    
    - Used in web-based authentication (e.g., AWS, Google, GitHub).

## **Modern Authentication & Authorization in Linux**

How authentication & authorization is managed depends on the **scale of the organization**.

### **Enterprise (Large Companies)**

1. **Centralized Authentication (LDAP, Active Directory, FreeIPA)**
    
    - Users authenticate against a central identity store.
    - Kerberos used for Single Sign-On (SSO).
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
    
    - Required for SSH, VPN, cloud access.
3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & SELinux**
    
    - Used to restrict users to least privilege access.
4. **Cloud-Based Identity Providers**
    
    - AWS IAM, Google Workspace, Azure AD.
5. **Zero Trust Security**
    
    - No implicit trust; access granted based on continuous verification.

---

### **Small Startups & DevOps Environments**

1. **Local Authentication (`/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`)**
    
    - Still used for small setups without centralized identity management.
2. **SSH Key Authentication**
    
    - Default authentication method in cloud environments.
    - Example:
        `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`
        
3. **OAuth/OpenID Connect for Web Apps**
    
    - GitHub, Google, Okta for authentication.
4. **Lightweight RBAC (e.g., `sudo`, Docker, Kubernetes RBAC)**
    
    - Instead of full-blown SELinux/AppArmor.
5. **Cloud IAM (AWS IAM, GCP IAM, Azure AD)**
    
    - Used for managing access in cloud-based deployments.

- **SSH keys, OAuth for web apps.**
- **Cloud IAM (AWS, GCP, Azure) replaces traditional user management.**
- **RBAC in Kubernetes/Docker instead of complex SELinux rules.**
