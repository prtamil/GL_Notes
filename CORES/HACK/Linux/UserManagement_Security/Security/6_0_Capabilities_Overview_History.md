## **Deep Dive into Capabilities in Modern Linux Security**

### **Mental Model of Capabilities in Security**

Think of **capabilities** as a **permission system** that breaks down the traditional **root/non-root** model into **smaller, isolated privileges**.

- **Traditional Model (Root vs. Non-Root)**
    
    - **Root (UID=0)**: Full control over everything.
    - **Non-Root (UID â‰  0)**: Limited control, relies on root via `setuid` binaries or sudo.
- **Capabilities Model**
    
    - **Processes have only the privileges they need** (e.g., bind to ports <1024 but nothing else).
    - **Reduces attack surface** by limiting what an attacker can exploit.
    - **Key Use Cases**: Containers, sandboxing, system hardening, privileged processes.

### **Topics in Modern Linux Security Related to Capabilities**

---

## **1. Linux Capabilities Internals**

- **Process capabilities** (`cap_permitted`, `cap_effective`, `cap_inheritable`)
- **File capabilities** (`setcap`, `getcap`, xattrs)
- **Ambient capabilities** (`prctl(PR_CAP_AMBIENT, ...)`)
- **Dropping capabilities permanently (`capset()`, `prctl()`)**
- **Capability bounding set (restricting inherited privileges)**

---

## **2. Namespaces & Capabilities (Process Isolation)**

- **How namespaces work** (User, PID, NET, MNT, IPC, UTS, Cgroup)
- **User namespaces & UID mapping**
    - Root inside a namespace isnâ€™t global root.
    - Why `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` is still too powerful.
- **Impact of capabilities inside namespaces**
    - Why dropping `CAP_NET_ADMIN` prevents network configuration.
- **Container security implications** (Docker, Kubernetes)

---

## **3. Seccomp (System Call Filtering)**

- **What is seccomp?**
    - Restricting system calls for processes.
- **Seccomp filters vs. Capabilities**
    - Capabilities restrict **actions**; seccomp restricts **syscalls**.
- **Creating a seccomp filter (`prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP)`)**
- **Real-world use case: Chrome sandboxing, Docker, systemd**
- **Why seccomp + capabilities are better together?**

    - `AmbientCapabilities=` (Assign caps to services)
    - `CapabilityBoundingSet=` (Restrict what a service can do)
- **Locking down system services**
    - `NoNewPrivileges=yes` (Prevents privilege escalation)
    - `ProtectSystem=full` (Read-only root filesystem)
    - `ProtectKernelModules=yes`
- **Comparing Systemd security to traditional Unix daemons**

- **OpenBSD `pledge()` & `unveil()` vs. Linux capabilities**
- **grsecurity & PaX role in hardening**
- **Why `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` is "the new root"?**

---

## **7. Hardening Real-World Services with Capabilities**

- **Reducing attack surface of critical services**
- **Locking down SSH, Web Servers, DBs using capabilities**
- **Running network services without full root (`CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`)**
- **Hardening CI/CD pipelines using capabilities**
- **Threat modeling with capabilities: What can an attacker do?**

## **Are Linux Capabilities Equivalent to OpenBSD `pledge()`?**

No, **Linux Capabilities** and **OpenBSD `pledge()`** serve different purposes, although both aim to **reduce privileges and limit process actions**.

### **Key Differences:**

| Feature            | Linux Capabilities                                                             | OpenBSD `pledge()`                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Granularity**    | Fine-grained privilege separation (e.g., network, file, process control)       | Coarse-grained; restricts syscalls based on "promises"                           |
| **How it works**   | Assigns individual privileges (e.g., `CAP_NET_ADMIN` for network control)      | Restricts a process to only use certain syscalls                                 |
| **Scope**          | Controls what a process **can do** (e.g., bind to port 80 without full root)   | Controls what a process **can access** (e.g., block access to files, networking) |
| **Flexibility**    | Process capabilities persist, can be modified                                  | One-way restriction: once pledged, cannot be revoked                             |
| **Implementation** | Uses `cap_get()`, `cap_set()`, `setcap`, and `prctl()`                         | Uses `pledge("stdio rpath", NULL)` syscall                                       |
| **Use case**       | Fine-grained privilege control in services, containers, and security hardening | Application self-containment to minimize damage from exploits                    |

### **Example of `pledge()` in OpenBSD:**

A process can restrict itself to only **read files and use stdio**:


`if (pledge("stdio rpath", NULL) == -1) {     perror("pledge");     exit(1); }`

- This prevents the process from making **network, file write, or execve() calls**, reducing attack surface.

### **Similarities**

- Both aim to **limit process privileges** to enhance security.
- Both **reduce attack surface** by limiting what a process can do.
- Both can be **used together** in security frameworks.

### **Main Takeaway**

- **Capabilities** are **specific privilege flags** that control what a process **can do**.
- **Pledge** is a **sandboxing mechanism** that controls what a process **can access**.

> OpenBSD also has `unveil()`, which is **more like chroot** but per file/directory level.

# Capablities History

## **History of Capabilities in Linux**

### **1. Unix and the Root Privilege Problem**

- Traditional **Unix privilege model** was **all-or-nothing**:
    - `root` (UID=0) had **unlimited power**.
    - Non-root users had **no special privileges**.
- This meant **privilege escalation attacks** could grant full system control.

### **2. Introduction of POSIX Capabilities (Late 1990s)**

- **POSIX.1e Draft 17 (1997)** introduced **capabilities** as a way to split root privileges into smaller **functional units**.
- Linux started implementing **capabilities** in **Kernel 2.2 (1999)**.

### **3. Early Implementation (Linux 2.2 - 2.4)**

- Capabilities were **process-specific**, meaning they were stored in `task_struct`.
- Early syscalls:
    - `capset()`, `capget()` to modify process capabilities.

### **4. File Capabilities (Linux 2.6.24, 2008)**

- **Extended attributes (xattr) on files** were introduced.
- `setcap` and `getcap` allowed **ELF binaries** to have capabilities **without needing setuid**.
- Example:
    
    
    `sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep /usr/sbin/tcpdump`
    
    - `tcpdump` can **capture packets** without full root privileges.

### **5. Namespaces & Containers (Linux 3.x, 2011+)**

- Capabilities became critical in **containerization**:
    - `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` was **too powerful** (almost root-like).
    - Docker introduced `--cap-add` and `--cap-drop` to control container privileges.

### **6. Security Frameworks (2015+)**

- Linux **Security Modules (LSMs)** like **AppArmor, SELinux, and Seccomp** started using capabilities for **fine-grained privilege control**.
- `prctl(PR_CAP_AMBIENT, â€¦)` introduced in **Linux 4.3 (2015)**, allowing **capabilities to persist across execve()**.

### **7. Capabilities Today**

- Widely used in **containers, sandboxes, security policies**.
- `systemd` uses `AmbientCapabilities=` to restrict services.
- Tools like **Flatpak, Snap, Firejail** rely on capabilities for app confinement.

---

## **Conclusion**

- **Capabilities** are **fine-grained privilege control** that replaces the all-powerful root model.
- They are **different from OpenBSD `pledge()`**, which is syscall-based sandboxing.
- **Originally proposed in POSIX.1e**, they became fully functional in **Linux 2.6** and **crucial for containers (Docker, LXC, Kubernetes)**.
- Capabilities continue evolving as **security tools** (e.g., seccomp, SELinux, AppArmor) integrate them for **least-privilege execution**.
