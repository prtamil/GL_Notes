### Your Current Standing Across 25 Skills

|#|Skill / Trait|Current %|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Programming craft|**85%**|Deep C/C++ + Python/JS, full-stack. Need more PowerShell & C# offensive fluency.|
|2|Systems internals (Win/Linux)|**40%**|You know ~30% Win, ~40% Linux. Solid debugging, but fundamentals not fully mastered.|
|3|Networking / TCP/IP|**50%**|Mid-level, need advanced packet analysis, pivoting, tunneling.|
|4|Active Directory|**10%**|Critical gap. No deep AD security/pivoting yet.|
|5|Exploit development|**25%**|Low-mid; driver skills help but not exploit chain mastery.|
|6|Reverse engineering|**30%**|Knows debugging, not RE workflow/IDA/Ghidra mastery.|
|7|Kernel & driver engineering|**60%**|Strong dev background, need offensive research + fuzzing.|
|8|PowerShell mastery|**25%**|Learning phase, early stage.|
|9|Telemetry & detection engineering|**20%**|Limited; Sysmon/ETW/EDR knowledge missing.|
|10|Fuzzing & vuln discovery|**20%**|Driver/code background helps, but fuzzing tools/workflow not applied.|
|11|C2 & post-exploitation|**15%**|Not practiced; design skills exist but needs offensive experience.|
|12|Cloud & container security|**40%**|You know k8s/Docker as developer; need attacker mindset.|
|13|OPSEC & tradecraft|**20%**|New area; not tested in simulated ops.|
|14|Measurement & experiment design|**35%**|As dev you experiment/debug, but not in red team/detection context.|
|15|Communication & tech writing|**60%**|Strong programming/architecture background; need more security-public outputs.|
|16|Teaching / presentation|**50%**|Likely decent from senior architect roles; not yet in security domain.|
|17|Analytical curiosity & pattern recognition|**80%**|Strong developer/debugger mindset.|
|18|Grit / persistence|**90%**|26 years coding shows grit. Key advantage.|
|19|Attention to detail / documentation|**70%**|Senior-level skills; need to convert to repeatable security labs/writeups.|
|20|Ethics & legal literacy|**30%**|Likely not explored in pentest context; must learn disclosure/ROE.|
|21|Project management & delivery|**70%**|Architect-level, but adapt to red-team engagements.|
|22|Networking (professional)|**30%**|Not yet security-community-facing.|
|23|Tooling & automation (IaC)|**60%**|Docker/K8s/DevOps strong; infra-as-code for labs/detection pipelines missing.|
|24|Business & consulting skills|**40%**|Senior role helps, but no red-team consulting exposure.|
|25|Public-facing productization|**10%**|No big security tool/book/blog yet â€” key to global recognition.|

### Summary

- **Strong foundation (70â€“90%)**: Programming, grit, debugging mindset, project mgmt, analytical skills.
    
- **Mid-level (40â€“60%)**: Linux/Windows internals, cloud/k8s, documentation, teaching, automation.
    
- **Low-level (<30%)**: AD, exploit dev, RE, PowerShell, C2, fuzzing, detection, OPSEC, networking visibility, public contributions.
    

ðŸ‘‰ This means youâ€™re **world-class in raw programming/debugging** but at **apprentice/intermediate in security ops-specific skills**. Thatâ€™s perfect â€” because the hardest part (sticking power + low-level coding chops) you already have.
