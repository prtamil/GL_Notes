## One-page mental model (remember this)

```js
Read protection  → SOP, CORS
Act protection   → CSRF, SameSite
Code protection  → XSS, CSP
Transport        → HTTPS, HSTS
Isolation        → Origin, Site Isolation

```

## The core truth (don’t forget this)

> **Browser security is about separating 
> 1. “who can read”, 
> 2. “who can act”, 
> 3. “who can execute code”.**
