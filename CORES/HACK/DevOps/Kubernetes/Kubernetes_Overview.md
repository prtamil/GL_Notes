## Distributed Sys : Kubernetes

- Promise Theory
- Level triggered vs Edge Triggered
  - LeveL Trigger :AK-47 trigger. as long as trigger pressed bullets keeps on coming
  - Edge Triggered : Revolver. once triger pressed only one bullet. then you need to release and trigger again
  - Keyboard: keep pressing chars keep printing :Level
  - mobile keyboard: keep pressing only one char :Edge
- Kubernetes :Level triggered. :Nodes comes backup ask api for status and Node makes itself to maintain for its status.
